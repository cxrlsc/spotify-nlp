Don't care if you do, cause it's understood
You ain't got no money, you just a no good

Ray Charles,I Can’t Stop Loving You,"I Can’t Stop Loving You Lyrics
(I can't stop loving you)
I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterdays
(Dreams of yesterday)

Those happy hours that we once knew
Though long ago, they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart

(I can't stop loving you)
I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterdays

(Those happy hours) Those happy hours
(That we once knew) That we once knew
(Though long ago) Though long ago
(They still make me blue) They still make me blue
(They say that time) They say that time
(Heals a broken heart) Heals a broken heart
(But time has stood still) Time has stood still
(Since we've been apart) Since we've been apart
(I can't stop loving you)
I said I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
Sing the song to me

Ken Nordine,Yellow,"Yellow LyricsIn the beginning--
Oh, long before that--
When light was deciding
Who should be in
And who should be out
Of the spectrum
Yellow was in trouble
Even then it seems that Green
(you know how Green can be)
Didn't want Yellow in
Some silly primal envy I suppose
But for whatever cause
The effect was bad on Yellow
And caused Yellow to weep yellow tears
For several eternals
Before there were years
Until Blue heard what was up
Between Green and Yellow
And took Green aside for a serious talk
In which Blue pointed out
That if Yellow and Blue were to get together
Not that they would but if they did
(a gentle threat)
They could make their own green
""Ohhh"" said Green with some understanding
Naturally by a sudden change of hue
Green saw the light and Yellow got in
It worked out fine
Yellow got lemons
And green got limesEmbed",?,"January 1, 1966"
Ken Nordine,Green,"Green LyricsAs an intellectual vibration smack dab in the middle of spectrum
Green can be a problem
That’s because there’s so many different greens inside of Green and each one has a different IQ
There’s the green that should never have happened:
The “stupid green.”
The green that is “green with envy.”
Then there’s the “so-so green,” the “who-cares-anyway?” green
But somewhere in Green is a green here and there that has something to say:
A truly intelligent green, a green with some integrity
That’s the kind of green for you and me
There’s a green to be seen with: vivid, vibrant, living alive!
We should spend the better part of our time, yours and mine, with a green like this
Maybe some of it would rub offEmbed",?,"January 1, 1966"
Ken Nordine,What Time Is It?,"What Time Is It? LyricsThere was this guy who was a regular guy who lived a regular life
Got up 7:30 every morning
Had the same breakfast
Kissed the same wife goodbye every morning
Went to the same office
Came home  Monday through Friday
On Saturdays, he played with the children
Did handywork around the house
Sundays, he took the family out on the station wagon to the suburbs
And there, they looked at the houses and the trees, the billboards, the gasoline stations, and the railroad crossings
And his life might have gone on like this forever
Except one night, something strange happened to him
You see, he went to bed at 10:30
And some of his friends stayed up later
And one of them, closing up a place that closed at two in the morning, decided to call this ""regular liver""
And said, ""What time is it?"", on the telephone
When he woke up and he said, ""Who's this? Who's this? It's, it's, it's two o'clock in the morning, it's no time to call. Bye!""
But the practical joker called every night, two o'clock in the morning
He did this for two weeks
Friend  said, ""Who is it? Stop!""
Finally, after two weeks, the practical joker lost interest in the joke and did stop
Then came two o'clock and the phone didn't ring
So he woke up
""Why isn't the phone ringing?""
He discovered that the only way that he could go back to sleep was to say, ""What time is it?""
Look at his watch and say, ""two o'clock""
And he could sleep
He did this a couple of nights until he began to think:
""It's two o'clock where I am
What time is it in New York? Or in Hollywood?
Or in London? Or in Hong Kong? And Cairo?""
He didn't know
So the next day, he went out and he bought himself some clocks
He got clocks from all over and he put them all over the walls
And the time was there
He knew what time it was everywhere that counted
And this made him feel comfortable
He became so interested in time that he got little egg timers and gave them away as presents
He read about time in, in books
Sidereal time: time way out in the universe
He knew what time it was on Arcturus and the Pleiades and the Milky Way
One night, though, at two o'clock in the morning, the light wouldn't go on; the fuse had blown
But suddenly, he realized he knew what time it was without even looking
Not only in the important cities of this world, but in the entire universe
And naturally, began to brag a little the next day
He told people, ""I know what time it is""
And they tested him and he did know
The Administration had changed at this particular time and they wanted to save money
So they got rid of all their astronomers, all their telescopes, their weights and measures
And they put this man in Washington in a little room
Where he sits to this day, simply saying:
""BEEP. The time now is...""Embed",?,July 1957
Ken Nordine,Lavender,"Lavender LyricsLavender is an old, old, old, old lady
Lavender is, aren't you?
I thought you were
Lady lavender in the indigo house
By the purple wood
Cobwebbed by spiders in magic magenta
Lavender, keeper of dark corners
In black, blue blood
Lady of the soft edges, tell us all or tell me
Where day goes with night
And what they do there
And what it means
The questions fall on your lavender lap
And your answer is
A lavender laugh
In a lavender cry
Near a lavender watch

I'll be leaving on a plane tomorrow
I'm going back and why I go, I just don't know
You know my memories of her, they are many
I've got to see that girl
I don't know if she has gotten married
People say she has a little baby
I don't care if she will bring me sorrow
I've got to see that girl

Girl from the mountain
I'm begging you, remember me please
Girl from the mountain
When are you gonna set my soul free

With my hair down to my shoulders sweating
There I was under a tropic setting
Climbin' way up to the top of the mountain
And just to see that girl
Yes, I'll be leaving on a plane tomorrow
I'm going back and why I go, I just don't know
You know my memories of her are so many
I've got to see that girl

Vuelve pronto a mi

Girl from the mountain
I'm begging you, remember me please
Girl from the mountain
When are you gonna set my soul freeEmbed","The only track on Power-Fuerza not written by the Ghetto Brothers, “Girl from the Mountain” is in fact a cover of a song written by Felix Tollinchi and originally recorded by The Harvey Averne Barrio Band for their self-titled 1971 record. The Averne record itself features a Tito Puente cover, for whom the Ghetto Brothers opened in an earlier incarnation nearly eight years before – one possible explanation for how the group decided to cover this relatively obscure track. But there is at least one other interesting connection between The Harvey Averne Barrio Band and the Ghetto Brothers. Averne was “one of several prominent Jewish Americans in New York’s bustling Latin music scene” – and so was Ghetto Brothers founder and bandleader Benji Melendez.

Though Melendez was Latino and in fact born in Puerto Rico (unlike Averne, who had no Latin or Hispanic heritage), Benji was also a crypto-Jew. On March 30th, 1492, Queen Isabella of Spain issued an expulsion decree giving Jews just four months to leave the country. Hundreds of thousands of people were expelled or murdered during this time. To avoid death, many Jews converted to Christianity, with some continuing to secretly practice Judaism. Nevertheless, during the Spanish Inquisition, many these hidden Jews, or “marranos” (Spanish word for pigs), were found and killed. Those that survived or fled continued to practice Judaism in secret, passing down rituals and traditions over generations. Growing up, Melendez recognized that his family had certain routines that were different from other families in their neighborhood, such as reading the Old Scripture on Saturdays, or how his father would “wrap himself into a bed sheet and mediate” on Fridays. It was not until Melendez was older that he realized his family’s unique traditions were in fact Jewish traditions, thanks to the help of a former teacher, Rita Fecher, who was Jewish herself. Although Melendez did not discover this truth about his family’s heritage until later in his life, it became a large part of his identity, and he attended the Intervale Jewish Center, the last synagogue of the South Bronx, until it closed.

Viva Puerto Rico libreEmbed","Benji Melendez’s family moved from Puerto Rico to New York in the late 1950s. Feeling ties to both the island and his new home where he grew up, Melendez considered himself to be Nuyorican. The song’s calls to “never forget that we are Boricuas” exemplifies his, and the rest of the Ghetto Brothers', desire to remember that heritage.

The Ghetto Brothers, whether as a band, gang, or community organization, were always involved in politics, and “Viva Puerto Rico Libre” is but one example of their engagement with the Puerto Rican independence movement. Ghetto Brothers' founder was inspired to create the group in part due to an interest in the Puerto Rican Socialist Party (PSP), one of several pro-independence, revolutionary political groups which operated in Puerto Rico and New York in the 1960s and 1970s. Where the PSP advocated for a total break with the US and its imperialist and capitalist policies, “Viva Puerto Rico Libre” is notably less political, calling only for Puerto Rico’s liberty. But lest the Ghetto Brothers be misread as shying away from overtly political messaging, one might refer to a televised speech given by Benjy Melendez in 1971, in which he stated:

We are being oppressed by the North American Yanqui. We the Puerto Ricans should rise up and defend ourselves against these dogs who will oppress us, and liberate our country from capitalism and imperialism. The North American is trying to steal our identity as Puerto Ricans, and call us Americans. We Puerto Ricans are Puerto Ricans from the day we are born until the day we die.”

Bunny spent money each and every day
She had it like that since the start of me
Because her man hit the number, and it must be told
He ran out of town and left Bunny at home
He shouldn't have gone out and left her that way
Because Bunny hit the number the very next day
She called the Daily News and then they told the Post
I heard her on the phone, she began to boast
They hung up the phone and rushed to the scene
To interview her in that brown limousine
She used a six door Caddy with the TV and bar
There was a space antenna at the back of the car
I watched her tour the streets all through the night
To make money like her you had to be alright

Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Then ya Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Money today is the root to all evil
I'm telling you the truth not trying to mislead you
It makes people act in a strange, strange way
And then they wind up in jail for 20 or 30 days
The best thing to do is just to cool out
You have a pocket full of money that's without a doubt
Because money today has gotten a little hard
So wake up in the morning and be ready to start
Now you're riding to work or going to school
Just do it every day and it'll help you
Your friends are laughing, joke
But pay them no mind cause you'll be making money all the time

Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Then ya Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy
Shake the boogie to the bang bang boogie

Money is funny and that's a fact
I know the party people who got it like that
The more money you make ya'll, the easier you sleep
So when you run into a man don't be cheap
I try to buy a couple houses and a couple diamond rings
Buy a pretty girl a pallet, you know she can sing
I'm making money ha, I'm making money ha

And you know that!

That money is here and it's not gonna go
So before I end my show I got to give you a taste
Of the man that's running first in this money making race
All the way from new york city with the voice of solid gold
The number one rapper that'll never grow old

I'm gonna go to the end now, ya'll

So that's how it happend in the middle of may
I bought me a jet a new place to stay
The bottle was mine so I gave it up
Yes a couple of days I ran in some luck
I found a place where I could rock it twice
So I'm down with sugarhill and I'm skating on ice
From north to south you hear it come out my mouth
From south to north when I rock back and forth
From west to east just to get a piece
From east to west cause they heard I'm the best

Busy Bee,Suicide,"Suicide Lyrics(Intro)
You're on air
Aw man, there goes that record again
Yeah, that's new by Busy Bee, that's that Suicide joint
Word! You mean he be rockin it ""When I was a...""
Yeah! that's the one he be rockin'
Homeboys I'm getting ready to dedicate this one to you
And to all you sucka guys, you know what time it is
Break it down Jay!
Ss-su-su-su-suu-suu-suicide
(I'm bout to kick the flavor, c'mon now)
Ss-su-su-su-suu-suu-suicide
You mess with me, you just committed suicide
(Gather round now, I'm bout to kick the flavor)
(Alright here it go)
(Verse 1)
Guess what! When I was a young boy, up in the South Bronx
I never carried a gun, was knocking out chumps
Punks, all faggots, plus sissies and creeps
You get in my face jack, I'll lay you out in the streets
With no weapons ya'll, not a chain or a bat
But I'll slap you upside ya head like my hand was your hat
You see so many have tried, many have died
And if you mess with Busy Bee, you might as well commit suicide
Ss-su-su-su-suu-suu-suicide
You mess with me, you just committed suicide
Not a homicide, but a suicide
(Verse 2)
The champion of knowledge, wisdom, understanding
If this was spoken then you all would throw your hand it
If rap was a crime, the rhyme would be libel
If rap was a book, then my mouth would be the bible
My rhymes are crescendo, a verbal assault
Talk it up, innuendo, but it's not my fault
By no means commercial, highly controversial
No practice or rehearsal, you mess with me I hurt you
I slay you in the mud, you dud, with no trouble
And bathe in your blood, I get with Mr. Bubble
Use the scar for a pillow and at the end of the day
Just like Calgon, they have to take you away
I'm gonna bury your remains in six feet up soil
You're looking kinda rusty, boy you need some oil
Your family is sad, your family cried
Cuz you messed with Busy Bee so you just committed suicide
Ss-su-su-su-suu-suu-suicide
You mess with me, you just committed suicide
Not a homicide, but a suicide
(Verse 3)
I...was...walking down the street mindin' my own biz
The MCs didn't know what time it is
After the battle, the boy just cried
I said you was better off if you just commit suicide
Paid with your life and fought Mike Tyson
Pour rap poison with your beans and rice
And got bit by a rat or hit by a bat
Go smoke some crack, you already tried that
Jump off a plane, fall out the train
Call my mama names you must be insane
Go wrestle alligators in the Everglades
Go sleep with somebody who just caught AIDS
Let a pit bull bite you, let me dynamite you
Swim in gasoline and let my homeboy light you
Drink some arsenic or sip some cyanide
Or mess with me and you will commit suicide!
Ss-su-su-su-suu-suu-suicide
You mess with me, you just committed suicide
Not a homicide, but a suicide
(I'm getting ready to kick a little favor now, lay down the law)
(Verse 4)
Rip somebody off is a robbery
Breaking in their house is the burglary
Stealing their car is grand larceny
Lying in court is perjury
Selling your body is prostitution
Got to go to court just to find a solution
Killing somebody is a homicide
But if you mess with me that's stone cold suicide
Ss-su-su-su-suu-suu-suicide
You mess with me, then you just committed suicide
My name is Busy Bee and I'll never lie
(Let's break it down now, let's clap my hands to the beat, let's go, let's see)
Go Busy! Go Busy Bee! Go Busy! Go Busy Bee! Go Busy!  (repeats)
Ss-su-su-su-suu-suu-suicide
You mess with me, then you just committed suicide
Ss-su-su-su-suu-suu-suicide

Busy Bee,Busy Bee’s Groove,"Busy Bee’s Groove Lyrics
Two weeks ago at the place to be
They was standing in line to to see the Busy Bee
I pulled up to the curb in the 98
Then we rushed inside so we wouldn't be late
The party was pack where you couldn't even move
Now everbody's rocking to the Busy Bee's Groove
(Wappa, wappa) ho!
Busy Bee, Busy Bee uaha!
(Wappa, wappa)
Everybody clap your hands, stomp your feet
Clap your hands, stomp your feet

Hey y'all, from coast to coast and from land to land
As the superfly brother with the master plan
With the beat that's unique to sound real sweet
To make you party to the rhythm seven days a week
Yes it's true that dreams can come true
If it happend to me, it can happen to you
So lets get up on our feet and let our fingers pop
Cause Busy Bee's just about ready to rock

Oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah
Oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah, ah, uh
Now you heard the rest and y'all ready to go
The baddest in hi-fi stereo
So just groove to the rhythm right groove to the beat
And you want to hear this record everyday of the week
Because the sound that you hear is so def to your ear
So have no fear, Busy Bee is here

Uh uh awh, Busy Bee!

I met a young lady that fainted on the scene
She always wanted to win the lotto that was her one dream
People gathered around and asked did she move
Did she jump back to life to the Busy Bee's Groove
Busy Bee makes ya dance, scream and shout
That's what the Busy Bee is all about
So before I go and before I quit
I'm gonna give you some more of this Busy Bee hit!

Hey y'all, one day I hit the number and it must be told
I won a million dollars and ten bags of gold
I took a lady shopping as I played the role
Of a rich millionare 22 years old
I called the daily news and then the pope
You shoulda heard me on the phone as I began to boast
Man, the hung up the phone and rushed to the scene
To interview me in that same Limousine
She used a six door Caddy with a TV and bar
A space antenna at the back of the car
I toured the streets all through the night
But to hang with Busy Bee you got to be alright
I said winter, spring, after that come fall
Any time you're ready just give me a call
We'll talk about the bird and the bees
And the way I rock the house for you young ladies
I was raised in the sun as strong as a ox
Slim, trim, fine as a fox
Right about this time I want y'all to know I choose the life they call the disco
So get up on your feet, let your fingers pop
Cause Busy Bee is here and I'm ready to rock
Awh, uh!
I rock New York City all years around
And my name is known all over the town
People here love the way I run my game
And they can't wait to see me make the Hall of Fame
Busy Bee is my name and that's a fact
And you can't beat that with a stick ball bat
Young ladies rock the house
And to all the fly guys rock the house
And you dance and you dance
And don't quit 'cause the music's designed to be a rock hit

Just ooh, ah, oh, uh, ah, uh, ah

I said there's a place, where the Ranch Boys go
You get a little cheeba and get gusto
But in order to you to come in our spot
You got to own three girls, a mansion and a yacht
And then you come inside, and peep a stride
You gotta get cash money to keep the game alive
And then stay on your feet from 9 to 5
Because the boys of the ranch don't take no jive

Oooh, ah, oh, uh, ah, ah, uh, ah, uh, uh, ah, ah
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Deejays, radio stations all over the nation
Take this record out your cover without hesitation
Cause it's a gift from me, the studio and the sky
When you're on the turntables you'll know why
The B-U-S-Y-B-E-E, the man who rocks the house most definitely
And he flows like a butterfly stings like a bee
He's not the latest but the greatest and they call him Busy Bee
You don't care if I'm the one because all you wanna do is have some fun
So put your hand on your hip I'll make your backbone slip
Put the pedal to the metal, feet with the beat
And get down, stop that messing around
Cause Chief Rocker Busy Bee is in your town
So clap your hands, do the freak dance
Become a victim of circumstance
'Cause everybody rocks when Busy Bee is down
Come alive y'all, c'mon!

Uh, ah, uh, ah, uh, uh, ah, uhuh, ah, ah, uhuh, ah, ah
Busy Bee, Busy Bee, Busy Bee, Busy Bee, Busy Bee
That's right I'm taking em' all out, all bums
All MCs that are bums I'm taking 'em all out
I'll straighten 'em out!
You got a problem MC, I'll straighten 'em out
Doctor you got a problem, I'll straighten 'em out
I'll take 'em all out!

N.W.A,Fuck tha Police,"Fuck tha Police Lyrics
Right about now, N.W.A court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me, huh
A young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops dying in L.A. 
Yo, Dre, I got something to say
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police (Example of scene one)

Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aw shit, now what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
'Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit
Alright, smart-ass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound (*Gunshots*)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck—
Fuck the police

*Knocking*
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open now (Aww, shit)
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest (*Battering ram*)
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em! (Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor! (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still, I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police (The verdict)

The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chicken shit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here! (I want justice!)
Get him the fuck out my face! (I want justice!)
Out, right now!
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police187Embed","“Fuck tha Police” takes the form of a trial against the LAPD, with Dr. Dre, MC Ren, and Ice Cube as judge, court officer, and witness.

Dr. Dre explained the song was created after the members of N.W.A were forced by police to lay face down in the street with guns to their heads.
However, the reason why the police were harassing them was because Eazy-E was doing drive-bys shootings on innocent people on bus stops with a paintball gun, as Dre explained in the HBO Documentary The Defiant Ones.

The song caught the attention of the FBI, which sent a letter to Priority Records about N.W.A’s album. Although the FBI did not refer to “Fuck The Police” by name, their letter claimed the album “encourages violence against and disrespect for the law enforcement officer.

The instrumental heard during the court house skit, samples Public Enemy’s “Bring The Noise”.

In a 2015 interview with DJ Vlad, DJ Yella claimed the song only took a day to make.","August 8, 1988"
N.W.A,Straight Outta Compton,"Straight Outta Compton Lyrics
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge
Straight outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(City of Compton, City of Compton)
Yo, Ren! (What's up?)
Tell 'em where you from!

Straight outta Compton, another crazy-ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(City of Compton, City of Compton)
Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming

Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton

I wonder who they fucked up today?
*Screeching Tires*
You motherfucker!
*Machine Gun Fire*
(Got him)

Pull over to the side right now
Man, fuck them motherfuckers!

Yo, Dre! Give me a funky-ass bassline!
Right here!
Here's a little somethin' about a nigga like me
Never should've been let out the penitentiary
Ice Cube would like to say
That I'm a crazy mothafucka from around the way
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out
Now I'm the mothafucka that you read about
Takin' a life or two, that's what the hell I do
You don't like how I'm livin'? Well, fuck you!
This is a gang and I'm in it
My man Dre'll fuck you up in a minute
With a right left, right left, you toothless
And then you say: ""Goddamn, they ruthless!""
Everywhere we go they say: ""Damn!""
N.W.A's fuckin' up the program
And then you realize we don't care
We don’t just say no, we’re too busy sayin', ""Yeah!""
About drinkin' straight out the eight bottle
Do I look like a mothafuckin' role model?
To a kid lookin' up to me
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me I’ll put my foot in your ass
See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta!
Hopin' you sophisticated motherfuckers
Hear what I have to say

When me and my posse stepped in the house
All the punk-ass niggas start breakin' out
'Cause you know, they know what’s up
So we started lookin' for the bitches with the big butts
Like her, but she keep cryin'
""I got a boyfriend""—bitch, stop lyin'!
Dumb-ass hooker ain't nothin' but a dyke
Suddenly I see some niggas that I don't like
Walked over to 'em, and said, ""What's up?""
The first nigga that I saw, hit him in the jaw
Ren started stompin' him, and so did E
By that time got rushed by security
Out the door, but we don't quit
Ren said: ""Let's start some shit""
I got a shotgun, and here's the plot
Takin' niggas out with a flurry of buck shots
Boom, boom, boom! Yeah, I was gunnin'
And then you look, all you see is niggas runnin'
And fallin' and yellin' and pushin' and screamin'
And cussin', I stepped back and I kept bustin'
And then I realized it's time for me to go
So I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that who-ride
N.W.A is wanted for a homicide
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
Fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta
He'll tell you exactly how he feel
And don't hold a fuckin' thing back

Homies all standin' around, just hangin'
Some dope-dealin', some gang-bangin'
We decide to roll and we deep
See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep
Real slow and before you know
I had my shotgun pointed in the window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin', I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin' all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didn't get no play from the ladies
With six niggas in a car—are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin'
We all said ""Fuck you, bitch!"" and kept goin'
To the hood, and we was fin to
Find somethin' else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nothin' at all
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
I might stumble, but still won't lose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit!
Man, what'cha gon' do now?
(What we're gonna do right here is go back)
How far you goin' back? (Way back)
""As we go a lil' somethin' like this""—hit it!

Here's a little gangsta, short in size
A t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
Built like a tank, yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and Eazy-E cold runnin' shit

Well, I'm Eazy-E, the one they're talkin' about
Nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
Police tried to roll, so it's time to go
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
With the {diamond in the back, sun-roof top}
Diggin' the scene with the gangsta lean
'Cause I'm the E, I don't slang or bang
I just smoke motherfuckers like it ain't no thang
And all you bitches, you know I'm talkin' to you
""We want to fuck you, Eazy!"" I want to fuck you too
Because you see, I don’t really take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you're fuckin' with
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put a foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta, Gangsta
He'll fuck up you and yours
And anything that gets in his way
Gangsta, Gangsta! That's what they're yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality

He'll just call you a low-life motherfucker

N.W.A,Express Yourself,"Express Yourself Lyrics
Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality
Man, you've been doin' all this dope producing, you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
So what you want me to do? (Express yourself)

I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink
To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well I'm dropping English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing
But making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel
Express yourself (Ah, ah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah)
Express yourself (Smoke, smoke)
Come on and do it (Yeah, kick it over here)
Express yourself (Do it, do it, )
Express yourself
Come on and do it

Now, getting back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you on the other end
Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show they go looking for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...
Express yourself (Yeah, yeah, yeah, )
Express yourself
Come on and do it (Yeah, yeah, do it)
Express yourself (Dr. Dre, Dr. Dre in full effect and N.W.A)
Express yourself
Come on and do it
Express yourself

From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob
Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus
Or a tumor but here's the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it
Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just
Express yourself (Yeah, yeah, this record's almost over, almost over, gotta get hyped up)
Express yourself (Do it, do it)
Come on and do it (Do it, do it, do it)
Express yourself (Compton's full of fakes, Compton's full of fakes, yeah)
Express yourself
Come on and do it (Do it, do it, do it)
Express yourself
Come on and do it (That's what she said, what she said)
Come on and do it
Come on and do it58Embed","A Dr. Dre solo number that samples and updates Charles Wright’s 1970s song of the same name. Notable for being one of the controversial group’s “clean” songs, and for Dre’s lyrical disavowal of weed, only a few years before his album-long celebration of the drug.

Ice Cube,No Vaseline,"No Vaseline Lyrics
Damn
Forgot to do somethin', let me see, uh
Oh, yeah— it ain't over, motherfuckers
The motherfuckin' saga continues
Y'all motherfuckers ready for N.W.A? Well, get the fuck up
A bitch is a bitch, so if you're poor—
It was once said by a man who couldn't quit, dope—
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
But now, since he stepped the fuck off
Here's what they think about you
That punk Ice Cube—
Here's what they think about you
Cube was suckin' so much New York dick
Here's what they think about you
Real niggas? Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace
Here's what they think about you
Why y'all let his punk ass in the group
Here's what they think about you
When they was in London, they wasn't no good without fuckin' Ice Cube
Here's what they think about you
When I bought the tape, all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin' money back
Here's what they think about you
I smell—
Here's what they think about you
N.W.A. ain't shit without Ice Cube
Here's what they think about you
Here's what they think about you
Cube was suckin' so much New York dick
Here's what they think about you
Real niggas? Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace
Here's what they think about you
That punk Ice Cube—
Here's what they think about you
Why y'all let his punk ass in the group
Here's what they think about you
I smell—
When I bought the tape, all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin' money back
Here's what they think about you
N.W.A. ain't shit without Ice Cube
Fuck all y'all
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas, now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who you foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ayy, yo, Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you been a dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flow
You done run a hundred miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T
'Cause you're getting fucked out your green
By a white boy, with no Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big bank take little bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair? Nah, cut them balls
'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for you, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide and conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren
'Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the first team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh, yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline
Now you're getting done— get— getting done
Now you're getting done— get— getting done
Now you're getting done without Va— Va— Va— Va— Vaseline

I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E would be hanging from a tree
With no Vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
'Til that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking 'bout?
Get rid of that devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play The Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you

Motherfuckin' Jheri Curl light, Ambi wearing motherfuckin' bitch101Embed","“No Vaseline” is Ice Cube’s diss track about his former group N.W.A and their manager, Jerry Heller.

Cube left N.W.A in 1989 over financial issues, and the group took shots at him on their 1990 EP 100 Miles & Runnin' and their 1991 album Niggaz4Life, particularly on their songs “Real Niggaz” and “Message to B.A..”

Producer Sir Jinx revealed the following information about the creation of the song:

We had “No Vaseline” in AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted—he just didn’t put it on the record. Then we did Kill At Will. And then [N.W.A.] started dissin’ Cube, and then that’s why we [said], “It ain’t over!” And that’s the last song on Death Certificate, ’cause we never wanted to beef with [Dr.] Dre and them. It wasn’t like that. The crowd saw it like that, but it was not like that. It was only [Ice Cube standing up for himself].

On “No Vaseline,” Cube responds and addresses Eazy-E and Jerry Heller with particularly harsh words, accusing them of unfairly exploiting the group. He refers to Heller as a “Jew,” and suggests that the group murder him—a move that motivated a prominent Jewish Rights Organization to boycott Cube’s music.

Cube’s wordplay, airing of dirty laundry, and passionate anger made “No Vaseline” one of the most celebrated battle rap songs ever. The song’s beat was produced by Cube and Sir Jinx, who sampled “Dazz” by ’70s funk band Brick.

N.W.A. never responded to “No Vaseline.” About a year after the song was released, the group effectively broke up when Dre left Ruthless Records for many of the same reasons Cube did.

Dre (and Snoop Doggy Dogg) responded to Cube on 1993’s “Fuck Wit Dre Day (And Everybody’s Celebratin’)”:

Then we gonna creep to South Central
On a street knowledge mission as I steps in the temple 
Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat
You trying to check my homey, you better check yourself
Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself, motherfucker

“No Vaseline” was later included on the Death Row Greatest Hits album, after Dre had split with the label. It’s widely believed Suge Knight released the track (and a related EP) as a dig at his ex-partner. The Death Row version omits the minute long intro and censors the word “Jew.” For similar reasons, the UK release of Death Certificate omitted the song altogether.

In the 2015 biopic Straight Outta Compton, “No Vaseline” is prominently featured in a particularly memorable scene that shows Eazy, Dre, Ren, Yella, and Jerry Heller reacting to hearing the song for the first time. Sir Jinx spoke further about Dre’s reaction:

Me and Dre done talked about it, and a couple of niggas got they ass whooped playing that song. You pulled up to Dre playin’ around…he might drag you out that car, jack. But, you know, [Dr. Dre is] my cousin—and you know I had the #1 song in [the movie] Straight Outta Compton, so it’s over with, you know?","October 29, 1991"
Ice Cube,It Was a Good Day,"It Was a Good Day Lyrics

Break 'em
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day

Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day
Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!
What the fuck am I thinkin' about?203Embed","Ice Cube describes his ideal day: a pork-free breakfast, Yo MTV Raps!, gambling, and a sexual rendezvous.

In 2012, a blogger calculated the exact day that Ice Cube describes in the song: January 20, 1992. The post generated a ton of publicity, eventually inspiring an internet campaign to put Ice Cube’s name on an actual blimp. The campaign was successful, and on January 20, 2014, Goodyear flew Ice Cube’s blimp over South Central, raising $25,000 for charity in the process.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4UqMyldS7Q

The song is featured prominently in the game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. It samples “Footsteps in the Dark” by the Isley Brothers.

Ice Cube has said in interviews that he liked to end his shows with this song. People would get riled up during the concert with his more aggressive songs, and he didn’t want them to leave the venue with that mentality. So he’d end with this mellow song to chill them out and reduce the odds of them doing something violent.","November 17, 1992"
Ice Cube,Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It,"Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It Lyrics
- Prior to gangsta rap music, the world was a peaceful place. And then all of that changed: violence, rape, murder, arson, theft, war. These are all things that came about as a result of gangsta rap music- But wasn't Compton dangerous before gangsta rap ?
- Wrong! Compton was a nature preserve for bunny rabbits. When gangsta rap came along, they tore down the country clubs and put up housing projects!

Walk up in there and show them that you equal
And don't be material

I never forgot Van Ness and imperial

It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual

I ain't gotta be fake, ‘cause he is my homie
If I sell a little crack

Ice Cube addresses the often held sentiment that gangsta rap (and one could argue, hip-hop in general), is directly responsible for many problems in today’s society. He does this throughout the song with absurd implications correlating dysfunctional behavior to listening to gangsta rap, “proving” that gangsta rap is the root of all problems. Ironically, the mental gymnastics Ice Cube’s lyrics take are not far from actual arguments posited by rap’s critics.","January 3, 2008"

50 Cent,In da Club,"In da Club Lyrics

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go shawty, it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
And we gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck, it's not your birthday

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed

When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh-huh)
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty nines in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga, roll that weed up! (Roll it!)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)
Now Shorty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow (Uh-huh)
Her girlfriend with her, they bi and they ready to go (Okay)
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Rubbed)

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah)

And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at yo' bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me:
""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let them hate, and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither, nigga
We in the club all the time, nigga, so pop, pop off, nigga

Originally planned as a D12 song for the 8 Mile soundtrack, producer Dr Dre played the instrumental for 50 who immediately wrote the song’s lyrics within an hour and recorded the bulk of the vocals that night.

According to The Billboard Book Of Number 1 Hits, when choosing which song should be Get Rich or Die Tryin's lead single, Eminem favored “If I Can’t”. But when 50 asked Dre for his opinion, he opted for “In da Club” instead. After a coin toss, “In da Club” was chosen.

“In da Club” was loved by music critics and fans alike, propelling the song to #1 in seven countries including the US in the spring of 2003. Eventually the song was certified platinum in four countries. It is one of 50 Cent’s most recognizable and well-known songs.","January 7, 2003"
50 Cent,21 Questions,"21 Questions Lyrics
New York City
You are now rockin'
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it

I just wanna chill and twist the lah
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ‘cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (Like that)
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions and they all about us

50 Cent,Many Men (Wish Death),"Many Men (Wish Death) Lyrics
Man, we gotta go get somethin' to eat
Man, I'm hungry as a motherfucker
Ayo man, damn
What's takin' homie so long, son?
50, calm down, he coming
(*nine gunshots*)
Ahh, ohh! What the fuck?!
Ah, son, pull off, pull off

Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin' with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
‘Cause I'll come and take your life away

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king, and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, ‘cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say ""Only God can judge me,"" ‘cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when 'Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you mu'fuckas all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
""Hommo"" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
‘Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men

50 Cent,Patiently Waiting,"Patiently Waiting Lyrics
Hey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?
(Ha-ha-ha) I owe you for this one

I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from 9/11 (Yeah)
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (Uh-huh)
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

You've been patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit—spray 'em, 50
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'? You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts to this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (Woo), it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

If the gun squad hearin' all the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50—man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

You know you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house (Yeah)
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face (Uh-huh)
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you're makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper (Uh-huh)
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper (Flipper)
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94, ""We don't love them hoes""
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the 6
Niggas wearin' flags 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and filled up with holes, motherfucker
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)

Sold-out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I light up Blu-rays
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

'Nother backend, I'm back on the road
Flooded Patek, paid off a show
Drippin' is rare, more this Vlone
Hoes by the pair, I'm never alone
Sleep on the Lear, Comme des Garçons
Drop eight in a two and let it dissolve
Balmain my denim, young GunWunna ball
Rock the whole concert and hopped in a frog
My foreign's a toy, I'm still a kid
10K this year for Coachella, it's lit
Rolls got umbrellas to cover her wig
Open Ceremony, left them in a trench
Lightning bolt diamonds 'cause I want revenge
We straight like a line, man, I really got rich
Some more fancy yellow diamonds in my piss
Don't get it confused, I'm still bangin' the six
New Cartier, Gunna a don
Niggas tryna soak up the drip like a sponge
Hatred's contagious, I keep me a gun
I'm focused on makin' a M in a month
Baby order twenty thousand in ones
Walk in and buy, I'm not asking how much
Red on the bottom, you need to catch up
Consistently droppin', I need me a dub

Me and young Gunna back at it again
We just left New York, double datin' with twins
I just bought a Wraith, I retired the Benz
I fired my bitch and I hired her friend
I see all the hate through these Cartier lens
Every two months tryna put up an M
My dog caught a body, they got it on film
He still rockin' Gucci watches in the pen
Take a trip 'round the globe then we do it again
Got 'em watchin' my drip, guess I'm settin' the trend
Louis backpack, hit the jet and I'm gone
I don't post what I do 'cause these niggas be clones
See these diamonds they hittin', these VVS stones
Got a championship ring, I just brought it home
FN is plastic, them bullets like pellets
This Givenchy jacket, this ain't Pelle Pelle
Sold out dates, you know I don't play
The last eight months straight, got no time for breaks
On they neck 'til it breaks, ain't pushin' no brakes
I got on two watches, I still come in late
It feel like my birthday, I'm gettin' this cake
I pop like I got it, I'm holdin' my weight
I control the projects, I'm pushin' this weight
I'm sippin' this sizzurp, I poured me an eight

Surfin' U.S.A11Embed","“Surfin' U.S.A.” is notable for giving the Beach Boys their first widespread success with its title track, and for Brian Wilson’s increasing prowess in songwriting, as well as vocal arrangement. The fuller-sounding vocals were achieved using double tracking, creating The Beach Boys' own unique sound. As with “Surfin' Safari”, some have speculated that “Surfin' U.S.A.” was not produced by Nick Venet, the officially listed producer, but by Brian Wilson.

This track featured lyrics by Brian Wilson, who intentionally set them to the music of “Sweet Little Sixteen,” by Chuck Berry, as he was inspired by that song. However, under pressure from Berry’s publisher and with threats of lawsuit, Wilson’s father and manager, Murry Wilson, gave the copyright for the song to Arc Music, Berry’s publisher.

It’s notable that “Fun, Fun, Fun,” another hit for The Beach Boys, sampled heavily from another of Berry’s songs, “Johnny B. Goode.”","March 4, 1963"

“God Only Knows” was composed and produced by Brian Wilson. Tony Asher helped Brian with the lyrics. Carl Wilson sang lead, and Bruce Johnston sang harmony vocals with Brian in the outro.

The song broke new ground in many ways. It was one of the first commercial songs to use the word ‘God’ in its title. As producer, Brian Wilson used many unorthodox instruments, including the harpsichord and French horns that are heard in the song’s famous introduction.

Although The Beatles engaged in a friendly rivalry with the Beach Boys based on mutual respect, Paul McCartney called this song the best song ever written.","July 18, 1966"
The Beach Boys,Wouldn’t It Be Nice,"Wouldn’t It Be Nice Lyrics
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

But happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray, it might come true
Oh, baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Oh, we could be married (Oh, we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
But wouldn't it be nice?

Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby24Embed","The opening track of Pet Sounds was later released as the  albums' third single with “God Only Knows” as its B-Side.

Listen for the rockin' accordions and the ethereal guitars in the introduction. Tony and I had visualized a scene. We had a feeling in our hearts, like a vibration. We put it into music, and it found its way onto tape. We really felt good about that record.
- Brian Wilson

The song was written with young people in mind and expresses the “never grow old” mentality.

Wouldn’t It Be Nice' was not a real long song, but it’s a very ‘up’ song. It expresses the frustrations of youth, what you can’t have, what you really want and you have to wait for it. The need to have the freedom to live with somebody. The idea is, the more we talk about it, the more we want it, but let’s talk about it anyway.

When he was a child, his mother told him that dogs could pick up “vibrations” from people, so that the dog would bark at “bad vibrations”. Wilson turned this into the general idea of vibrations (and Mike Love putting “good” in front of vibrations), and developed the idea of people being able to do the same with emotions.

This song is revolutionary in a couple of ways. Firstly, the song is a for the time unusual form:
A B A' B C D B E
There is a lot of new material (C, D and E), where most previous songs only had A’s and B’s and sometimes a bridge. Furthermore, these new parts are not in obvious ways musically connected to previous parts.
Second, there is a ton of instruments that were completely new to this type of music, most notably an Electro-Theremin. This song and the album Pet Sounds in general greatly influenced the Beatles, which resulted in Sgt. Pepper.","October 10, 1966"

Why don't you live up there?
Why don't you do what I do
See what I feel when I care?

Elton John,Your Song,"Your Song Lyrics
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

The song tells of “Bennie and the Jets”, a fictional band of whom Elton John is a supposed fan. In interviews, Taupin has said that the song’s lyrics are a satire on the music industry of the 1970s.

Producer Gus Dudgeon, in keeping with the theme of a band that’s more show than substance, hit upon the idea of turning the original studio track into a fake live song, by simulating crowd noise.","February 4, 1974"

To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found

Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

Written by Elton and his co-songwriter Bernie Taupin, “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” is about wanting to give up a life of opulence for a simpler life away from all the glitz and glamour. Since Elton himself was living deep in the high life at the time, it can be said that this message is more relevant to Bernie than Elton, for he was often the guy that preferred to keep it low key compared to his more famous partner.

It is one of Elton John’s most famous and commercially successful singles, topping the Canadian RPM 100 Top Singles Chart and peaking at #2 on the US Billboard Top 100. It’s also considered one of the best songs he’s ever made.","October 5, 1973"

Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick, and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after—

Sometimes, you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""Go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me

If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting

After Lauper had already recorded the large majority of her debut album—She’s So Unusual—her producer Rick Chertoff insisted she needed “one more song.” Chertoff introduced her to Hyman and they began working on the song.

Lauper came up with the title while reading TV Guide—Time After Time was a 1979 science fiction movie starring Malcolm McDowell as H. G. Wells, portraying him inventing a time traveling machine.

Lauper’s label initially wanted this song to be her first single before she convinced them to go with “Girls Just Want To Have Fun.” In her memoir, Lauper recounts:

When the album was completed, the label wanted the first single to be “Time After Time.” But I kept saying to them, “Listen to me—releasing a ballad first defines you in a certain way. You become known as a balladeer, and it can kill your career.”","January 27, 1984"

Lauper came up with “a very, very creative departure from” what songwriters Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly had originally written and presented to her.

The song became Lauper’s second and final #1 in the US in late 1986. It also was a huge hit internationally, reaching the top 20 in eight other countries including a #12 peak in the UK.

“True Colors” has been covered by many artists including The Weeknd and Phil Collins, who had success with it overseas. The song has also been found in mainstream pop culture many times, from late 80s Kodak commercials to the 2016 film Trolls where it is sung by Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick.

Lauper had a friend who’d recently died of AIDS in mind while singing “True Colors”, and over time the song has grown to become an anthem for the LGBT-community. In 2015 Cyndi Lauper opened a shelter for homeless gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender youth. The shelter was named after this song.

The True Colors Residence, named after her 1986 hit “True Colors,” will be located on West 154th St. near Frederick Douglass Blvd. in Harlem. The residence, the first permanent housing facility of its kind in the city, was conceived by the singer, her manager and the West End Intergenerational Residence, a non-profit focused on providing housing for homeless families and the elderly.","August 25, 1986"

Nevertheless, the song ended up accelerating the tensions within the group. The original plan for this song called for Debbi Peterson to sing the whole thing, but their producer, David Kahne, decided to have one person sing one verse. There are only three verses, though, so one person would have to get left out. That person ended up being Debbi Peterson, when David Kahne decided to have Micki Steele sing the second verse instead of Debbi (Vicki Peterson sang the first verse and Susanna Hoffs sang the third). Debbi didn’t play drums on the song either, when the producer decided that drum machines were the hip sound of 1987 (which they kinda were – ‘87 was a weird time).

With this song and “Walk Like an Egyptian”, the Bangles became only the third girl group to score multiple #1s in the United States, after the Supremes (12) and the Shirelles (2).

Steinberg explains the song’s origins:

Susanna was talking about the Bangles having visited Graceland, and she said there was some type of shrine to Elvis that included some kind of eternal flame. As soon as those words were mentioned, I immediately thought of the synagogue in the town of Palm Springs, California where I grew up.

Duran Duran,Ordinary World,"Ordinary World Lyrics
Came in from a rainy Thursday
On the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV
And the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart
What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Papers in the roadside
Tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here beside the news
Of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk
(Just blown away)

And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Every world
Is my world
(I will learn to survive)
Any world
Is my world
(I will learn to survive)
Any world
Is my world
Every world
Is my world17Embed","“Ordinary World” is the second track off of Duran Duran’s 1993 self titled album, known as “The Wedding Album.“ It was a big comeback single for the band, and is one of the two singles that made Duran Duran relevant again; Simon LeBon says he was inspired to write it after not being recognized in the supermarket after a long period of sustained fame, hence being once again part of an ""ordinary world.”","December 1, 1992"
Duran Duran,Come Undone,"Come Undone Lyrics
Mine, immaculate dream
Made breath and skin, I've been waiting for you
Signed, with a home tattoo
Happy birthday to you was created for you
(Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you've taken my heart to pieces)
Oh, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me into crime

Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?

Words, playing me deja vu
Like a radio tune, I swear I've heard before
Chills, is it something real
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers?
(Can not forgive from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you're taking my heart to pieces)
Lost, in a snow filled sky
We'll make it alright
To come undone now
We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me into crime

Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?

(Can not forgive from falling apart)
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)
Who do you need, (Who do you love) who do you love?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)
(Who do you love) Who do you love
When you come undone?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)17Embed","“Come Undone” is the sixth track of The Wedding Album by English band Duran Duran, published on February 11, 1993 by the label Capitol (for the US), Parlophone UK and EMI Music.

The song was released in March 1993 as the second single, after the international hit “Ordinary World”, from the album and it had a considerable success, entering in the top ten in all the most relevant charts in the world and reaching number one in Israel. “Come Undone”, as well as the previous single, is supposed to be a significant marker of Duran Duran’s entry in adult contemporary radio format.

The instrumentation, substained by a sample of the legendary instrumental break “Ashley’s Roachclip” by The Soul Searchers, was cured by Warren Cuccurullo, the group’s guitarist at the time, whereas the lyrics were written by the lead singer Simon Le Bon as a gift for his wife Yasmin. Even though this is one of the best-known songs of the band, it was added to The Wedding Album only during the last recording sessions, as it was originally recorded for a side-project by Nick Rhodes!","February 23, 1993"

Ha-ha!

Darken the city, night is a wire
Steam in the subway, earth is afire
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
Woman you want me, give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Straddle the line, in discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Mouth is alive, with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Stalked in the forest, too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
High blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight
You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Scent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine I'm after you
Mouth is alive, all running inside
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Hungry like the wolf

Hungry like the wolf

Burning the ground, I break from the crowd

Lyrically, it was inspired by the fairy tale, Little Red Riding Hood, while sonically, fiddling around with burgeoning technologies such as Roland’s 808 and Jupiter 8 keyboard produced the distinctive groove, according to a 2003 interview with the band for Blender Magazine.

The song was the group’s breakout hit in the US and Canada. In early 1983, it topped the chart in Canada and became their first of nine top 5 hits in the States, peaking at #3. They’d already been in the top 40 four times in their homeland the UK, where this one reached #5.","May 10, 1982"
Duran Duran,Rio,"Rio Lyrics
Moving on the floor now, babe, you're a bird of paradise
Cherry ice cream smile, I suppose it's very nice
With a step to your left and a flick to the right
You catch that mirror way out west
You know you're something special
And you look like you're the best

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can
Oh, Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on TV
Two of a billion stars, it means so much to me
Like a birthday or a pretty view
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can
Oh, Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

Hey now, woo, look at that
Did he nearly run you down?
At the end of the drive, the lawmen arrive
You make me feel alive, alive, alive
I'll take my chance 'cause luck is on my side or something
I know what you're thinking
I tell you something, I know what you're thinking

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twists across a dusty land
And when she shines, she really shows you all she can
Oh, Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande
Her name is Rio, she don't need to understand
And I might find her if I'm looking like I can
Oh, Rio, Rio, hear them shout across the land

In Wannabe: How the Spice Girls Reinvented Pop Fame, Rowe remembers the impression they left on him that day:

I loved them. Immediately.  The studio was pretty small, and they all sat on one chair on each other’s laps in a line. I don’t know how they managed it…They were like no one I’d met before, really.

The song was written and recorded quickly.  Victoria missed the writing session for the track, though tried to pitch in over the phone. The song’s divvied up among the girls equally, except for Victoria, who contributed only backing vocals to the track. She regretted missing out. In her 2004 autobiography Learning to Fly, she recalled:

I just couldn’t bear not being there. Because whatever they said about how it didn’t matter, it did matter.

The label did not like the first outcome of the song, and got producer Dave Way to give the track an R&B influenced backing track. The group didn’t think this was the right vibe, and eventually sent it to be mixed by Mark Stent. This became the final version of the song.

Their label, Virgin Records, wanted “Say You’ll Be There” to be the band’s debut single, however the group fought for this song. Eventually got their way.

“Wannabe” lyrics addresses the value of female friendship over a female-male bond. It soon after became an iconic symbol of female empowerment and one of the group’s most popular songs.","June 26, 1996"

I decided we should be friends, hey

Tell me, will this deja vu never end? Oh

Now you tell me that you've fallen in love
Well I never ever thought that would be, ay

Throwing far too much emotions at me

But any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

And all that I want from you
Is a promise you will be there

Ow, say you will be there
A-won't you sing it with me?
If you put two and two together
You will see what our friendship is for, oh
If you can't work this equation then
I'll guess I'll have to show you the door

There is no need to say you love me
It would be better left unsaid

I'm (I'm), giving you everything (I'll give you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)

M.I.L.F. is a commonly used acronym that stands for “Mother I’d Like To F***.” However, Fergie has expressed a desire to see it changed to the less objectifying “Moms I’d Like To Follow.”  The music video subliminally features this alternate reading many times.

The title uses symbols to play on another double meaning: “MILF Money” and the plural, “MILFS.” Fergie uses the lyric “MILF money” throughout the song to refer to her status as a high-earning, independent, and sexy mother. The second meaning for “MILFS” refers to her dedication of the song to all MILFs and their hustle, particularly the other women in her celebrity crew.

Hours after the premiere of this song, Fergie released the music video which features Hollywood’s “hottest” moms.

Kim Kardashian, who is included in the video spoke about the song on her website saying:

Do you guys see those 10-inch gold heels I had to wear in the milk shower?! It was not easy, but I think it looks hot. We literally shot this all day, then I got on a plane and flew to New York to shoot the GQ cover the next morning. It was the craziest week!","June 25, 2016"

Wear them gold and diamond rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperones and limousines, shopping for expensive things
I be on the movie screens, magazines and bougie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell, drive-through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show or after the Grammy's
I like to go cool out with the family
Sipping, reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm...

You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Plus I gotta keep enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish
Lifestyle so rich and famous, Robin Leach will get jealous
Half a million for the stones
Taking trips from here to Rome

'Cause I remember yesterday, when I dreamt about them days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope

Olivia Rodrigo,​drivers license,"​drivers license Lyrics
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street367Embed","“drivers license” is the first single and third track on Olivia Rodrigo’s debut album SOUR. It is a possible love ode about Rodrigo moving on from her previous relationship with Joshua Bassett, who is now supposedly dating Sabrina Carpenter, by doing the one last thing that she promised him—getting a driver’s license. The song showcases a brilliant balance of unfiltered outpouring and graceful specificity. Its accompanying music video spins a vivid portrait of Rodrigo as she drives aimlessly, longing for an ex-love.

The song was teased several times before its release in January 2021. On July 23, 2020, Olivia posted a snippet of the song on Instagram with the caption “wrote dis the other day. vv close to my heart. gonna call it drivers license I think lol.” She then posted another two snippets in December 2020, captioning them with “soon” and “sooner.” On January 4, 2021, she announced the song as her debut single.","January 8, 2021"
Olivia Rodrigo,​deja vu,"​deja vu Lyrics
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you

Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu183Embed","“deja vu” is the second single from Olivia Rodrigo’s debut studio album, SOUR, and her first release since the breakout success of her debut single, “drivers license.” This song finds Olivia at a different stage than its predecessor, with her beginning to move on from heartbreak. Olivia questions both the authenticity of her ex’s new relationship, as well as their emotions for their new girl. She also portrays feelings of pity towards this new girl, who is not experiencing anything unique with her now-lover.

Despite sharing similar themes, “deja vu” is musically different from “drivers license,” with a more upbeat melody. It shows influences from Taylor Swift, both melodically and lyrically, especially in the bridge and outro—an interpolation of Taylor’s August 2019 song “Cruel Summer” was officially credited months after release. The music video shows Olivia spying on another woman—played by actress Talia Ryder—and emulating her life out of adoration, including wearing nearly identical clothing, traveling to the same locations, and copying her actions. Eventually, the woman makes it known that she was aware of Olivia’s stalkery the entire time, and taunts her, leaving Olivia enraged.

In the week preceding its release, Olivia cleared all of her posts on her Instagram account and began posting a series of cryptic videos, showing various clips on an analog television. Three of these teasers were shared before the official announcement of the song on March 29, 2021. The day before its release, Olivia posted an acoustic snippet of the song on TikTok.","April 1, 2021"

You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily248Embed","“good 4 u” is the third single from Olivia Rodrigo’s debut studio album, SOUR. The song’s hook is laced with sarcasm, as Olivia sharply addresses her former partner for quickly moving on from their relationship without much of an issue or any care towards her at all. Like with her previous single, “deja vu,” Olivia again experiments musically, this time using drums and a guitar as primary instruments to emphasize her anger building up as the song progresses. Its angsty, pop-rock sound has drawn comparisons to 2000s acts like Paramore and Avril Lavigne.

In the music video, Olivia plays a high school cheerleader who is feeling distraught and vindictive over her former partner. She purchases a container of gasoline from a convenience store and appears to destroy her ex’s bedroom, setting it ablaze and causing it to flood. In the final shot, Olivia submerges herself into a lake with glowing red eyes—a subtle homage to the 2009 cult classic Jennifer’s Body in which Jennifer stares into the camera with bloodshot eyes while swimming in a lake.

Olivia first teased the song and its music video on April 26, 2021, by posting an Instagram photo showing her dressed as a cheerleader. On May 9, 2021, the song was revealed to be her next single in SOUR’s album trailer shown at theatrical screenings of In The Heights. The next day, its release was officially announced by Olivia on Instagram.

In the US, “good 4 u” debuted at #1 on May 29, 2021, her second chart-topper there. In the UK, it debuted at #2, then held the top spot for five weeks – the most by a guitar-driven song since the four weeks spent by Evanescence’s “Bring Me To Life” in 2003. The song has also topped pop charts in over a dozen more countries around the world.","May 14, 2021"
Olivia Rodrigo,All I Want,"All I Want Lyrics
I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?

And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you

All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?

I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily

Ahhhh ha ha10Embed","The Temptations' “Papa Was A Rollin' Stone” was written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong and produced by Whitfield. Released as a single on the Gordy label in late September 1972, the song became an instant smash, and only the veteran group’s third single – after 1964’s “My Girl” and 1971’s “Just My Imagination” – to hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 (though it only reached #5 R&B). The Tempts' version was actually the song’s second single release. Whitfield had initially recorded the song – in a more typical funk arrangement, with lush, almost Latin-inflected instrumentation – on second-tier Motown group The Undisputed Truth, who had a minor hit with it (#24 R&B) earlier in the year. “Papa” was a critical as well as a commercial success, garnering three Grammy Awards in 1973 for the group, the songwriters, and long-time Motown arranger Paul Riser.

At 6:54, “Papa” was easily the longest track Motown had released as a single up to that point, and quite a departure from the company’s “in-and-out-in-under-three-minutes” ethos of the previous decade. The LP version – appearing on the Tempts' album All Directions – is nearly twice as long at over twelve minutes.

With its relatively sparse but expansive instrumentation, the song marks something of a departure from the Sly and the Family Stone-influenced “psychedelic soul” of the early Dennis Edwards era, into the more “orchestral funk” sound that Isaac Hayes and others had made popular through their soundtrack work on so-called blaxploitation films. Like most of the group’s singles since 1968, however, “Papa” finds the Temptations sharing lead vocals. Dennis Edwards, Richard Street, Damon Harris, and Melvin Franklin all snatch a verse of their own, with only founding member and group leader Otis Williams declining to step up to the mic.

It was released as a single on January 14, 1971 and reached #1 on both the pop and R&B charts, making it one of the Temptations' most popular and enduring hits. The song also appeared on the group’s album Sky’s The Limit later that year. While nearly all of the Temptations' singles since 1968 had featured a “psychedelic soul” sound inspired by Sly & The Family Stone, “Just My Imagination” abandons this approach and instead hearkens back to the love ballads that had been the group’s bread and butter in the mid-1960s.

The song was also the last Temptations single to feature longtime members Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams (who sings the line “Every night on my knees I pray”). Both had been with the group from its inception way back in 1957 and before that had even sung in church together as children. Kendricks had never been a fan of the psychedelic soul sound the Temptations adopted in 1968, and after leaving the group he launched a successful solo career singing primarily the kinds of love ballads for which he had previously been known. Williams, sadly, was forced to retire from the group due to personal issues and health problems related to sickle-cell anemia. He committed suicide in 1973.

The Rolling Stones recorded “Just My Imagination” in 1978 for their album Some Girls.

The Supremes,You Can’t Hurry Love,"You Can’t Hurry Love Lyrics
I need love, love
To ease my mind
I need to find, find
Someone to call mine
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love
To let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Yeah, it's almost gone
I remember mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break?

No I can't bear
To live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love
To call my own
But when I feel that I
I can't go on
These precious words keeps me hangin' on
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
(Now wait)
No, love, love
Don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
I keep on waiting (Ooh, until that day)
But it ain't easy
It ain't easy
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
(repeat and fade)3Embed","“You Can’t Hurry Love” is a song performed by American female vocal group and Motown Records' most commercially successful act The Supremes. Written and produced by one of Motown’s more accomplished songwriting teams Holland-Dozier-Holland (Brian & Eddie Holland and Lamont Dozier), the song features the silky smooth vocals of Diana Ross on lead and Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson on background vocals, as well as Motown’s session band, The Funk Brothers, helping out on all of the instrumentation. The song was recorded on June 11th and July 5th, 1966, in Hitsville U.S.A. (Studio A). It was released soon after on July 25th, 1966, as the second single from their ninth studio album “The Supremes A' Go-Go” on Motown Records on August 25th that same year, following their first single “Love is Like an Itching in My Heart.” The single was also the A-side to “Put Yourself in My Place,” a track that was actually recorded by four different Motown artists and groups, including The Supremes.

“You Can’t Hurry Love” was released in the middle of the group’s transition from the sounds of their earlier teenage, bubblegum pop phase – which is understandable considering all of their previously released music was recorded when they were in their late teens and early 20s – to more mature themes and musical arrangements.  With this development of their sound came the peak of the group’s success, topping the charts both in the United States and internationally. “You Can’t Hurry Love” was The Supremes' seventh number-one hit single on the Billboard Hot 100, claiming the top spot for two weeks in September 1966. The single also reached number one on the soul chart for two weeks, number one on the U.S. Cash Box Pop Singles chart, peaked at number three on both the Canadian RPM Singles and the U.K. Singles charts, and reached number six on the Australian Singles chart, to name a few. The single also peaked at number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and the U.K. Singles year-end charts. Additionally, the song was permanently inducted into the list of “500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll,” sponsored by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The song was later covered by a number of artists, including the Dixie Chicks on the soundtrack to the 1999 film “Runaway Bride.” However, the most notable cover of “You Can’t Hurry Love” was performed by English vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Phil Collins in November 1982 on his second studio album, “Hello, I Must Be Going!”. Collins' version topped the U.K. Singles charts – a feat not previously achieved by The Supremes and Collins’s first number-one hit in his home country – and peaked at number ten in the U.S. Collins explains that his version of the song was not meant to serve as an interpretation of the original Supremes tune but, rather, as a remake. Many of his musical influences came out of Motown, so his cover was meant to serve as a thankful tribute  to the record company who later influenced his musical stylings. Lamont Dozier, one of the song’s original writers, later commented on Collins’s cover, saying that it was respectful to Motown to keep so many of the original aspects of the song and that his cover was very well done.","August 25, 1966"

Baby love, my baby love
I need you, oh how I need you
But all you do is treat me bad
Break my heart and leave me sad
Tell me, what did I do wrong
To make you stay away so long
'Cause baby love, my baby love
Been missing ya, miss kissing ya
Instead of breaking up
Let's do some kissing and making up
Don't throw our love away
In my arms, why don't you stay?
Need ya, need ya

Baby love, my baby love
Why must we separate, my love
All of my whole life through
I never loved no one but you
Why you do me like you do?
I get this need
Ooh, ooh, need to hold you
Once again, my love
Feel your warm embrace, my love
Don't throw our love away
Please don't do me this way
Not happy like I used to be
Loneliness has got the best of me

I need you, oh how I need you
Why you do me like you do
After I've been true to you
So deep in love with you
Baby, baby, ooh till it's hurtin' me

Don't throw our love awayEmbed","“Baby Love” is a 1964 song recorded by American music group The Supremes for their second studio album, Where Did Our Love Go, and was written and produced by Motown’s main production team Holland–Dozier–Holland.

According to Rolling Stone, Motown label owner Berry Gordy at first thought the song “wasn’t catchy enough”, and sent the group back to the studio, resulting in the catchy “Oooh” at the beginning.

It was their second song that topped the charts, making them the first Motown group that had two #1 songs.

In 2021, the song placed #499 in Rolling Stone’s “500 Best Songs of All Time”.","September 17, 1964"
The Supremes,Stop! In the Name of Love,"Stop! In the Name of Love Lyrics
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart

Baby baby, I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet

But this time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(Think it over)
After I've been good to you
(Think it over)
After I've been sweet to you

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over
I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her, maybe one or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?

This time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(Think it over)
Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over)
Haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid of losing you forever
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart (Baby, think it over)
Stop in the name of love (Think it over, baby)
Before you break my heart (Ooh, think it over, baby)

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love

It was written by Lamont Dozier and brothers Brian and Eddie Holland—Motown’s premiere songwriting team. This song marked something of a new start for Holland-Dozier-Holland, as they wanted to try weightier subject matter.
According to Dozier, the song’s one-note guitar part was inspired by Morse Code-style radio news flashes.

Holland-Dozier-Holland got out of Motown’s life in 1967—this was the last of their Supremes hits before leaving the label.

Generations of fans have hung on to this song—it’s returned to the charts on three different occasions. In 1967, psychedelic rockers Vanilla Fudge reached #6 on the Hot 100 with their version.

In 1986, British singer Kim Wilde took the song to back to #1. Wilde’s success made “You Keep Me Hangin’ On” one of the only hits to top the charts by two different artists.

In 1996, country singer Reba McEntire dropped a version that climbed to #2 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.","October 26, 1966"

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch

""Stink, stank, stunk!""

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched with moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap overflowing with the most disgraceful
Assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable, mangled up in tangled up knots!
You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch
With a nauseous super ""naus""!

Performed by Thurl Ravenscroft, the song is used as a musical interlude to add emphasis to the Grinch’s nastiness and sick nature.

Despite his performance, Thurl was not credited for the song on the special, leading many to believe that the narrator and voice of the Grinch for the special, Boris Karloff, performed the song as well. Rumors also floated around that Tennessee Ernie Ford was responsible for the song.","December 18, 1966"

As of 2001, according to Publishers Weekly, it was the fourth best-selling English-language children’s book of all time.

Green Eggs and Ham is unique in that it was  written on a bet. Dr. Seuss' editor, Bennett Cerf, bet him that he couldn’t write a book using only 50 words. This was no small feat because, by comparison, the relatively simple Cat in the Hat had used about 225.

Dr. Seuss won that bet. This book uses only 50 words, all of which are found in this highlighted paragraph, which are: a, am, and, anywhere, are, be, boat, box, car, could, dark, do, eat, eggs, fox, goat, good, green, ham, here, house, I, if, in, let, like, may, me, mouse, not, on, or, rain, Sam, say, see, so, thank, that, the, them, there, they, train, tree, try, will, with, would, and you.

The story has appeared in several animated adaptations, starting with 1973’s Dr. Seuss on the Loose: The Sneetches, The Zax; Green Eggs and Ham, starring Paul Winchell as the voice of both Sam-I-Am and the first-person narrating man.",

Congratulations!
Today is your day.
You're off to Great Places!
You're off and away!
You have brains in your head.
You have feet in your shoes
You can steer yourself
Any direction you choose.
You're on your own. And you know what you know.
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.
You'll look up and down streets. Look 'em over with care.
About some you will say, ""I don't choose to go there.""
With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet,
You're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.
And you may not find any
You'll want to go down.
In that case, of course,
You'll head straight out of town.
It's opener there
In the wide open air.
Out there things can happen
And frequently do
To people as brainy
And footsy as you.
And when things start to happen,
Don't worry. Don't stew.
Just go right along.
You'll start happening too.
OH!
THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!
You'll be on your way up!
You'll be seeing great sights!
You'll join the high fliers
Who soar to high heights.
You won't lag behind, because you'll have the speed.
You'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead.
Wherever you fly, you'll be the best of the best.
Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.
Except when you don' t
Because, sometimes, you won't.

You'll get mixed up, of course,
As you already know.
You'll get mixed up
With many strange birds as you go.
So be sure when you step.
Step with care and great tact
And remember that Life's
A Great Balancing Act.
Just never forget to be dexterous and deft.
And never mix up your right foot with your left.
And will you succeed?
Yes! You will, indeed!

Be your name Buxbaum or Bixby or Bray
Or Mordecai Ali Van Allen O'Shea,

Written by Smokey Robinson, it was first recorded by The Miracles in 1960. Since then, it has been covered by various artists including The Temptations and The Supremes.



Released as the B-Side to I Want You Back, in 1969, the Jackson 5 cover is the most famous version.  It’s notable for young Michael’s outstanding vocal performance.

The Jackson 5 performed this song on their first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show.

During live performances, Michael usually provided an intro about how he met a girl at school during sandbox. They  shared cookies and then had an unfortunate falling out during finger painting. The segment typically ended with “I stepped up to her and I said…”  leading into the song’s opening line.","December 18, 1969"

Diana Ross,Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,"Ain’t No Mountain High Enough Lyrics
If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
On that you can depend and never worry
You see, my love is alive
It's like a seed that only needs the thought of you to grow
So if you feel the need for company
Please, my darling, let it be me

I may not be able to express
The depth of the love I feel for you
But a writer put it very nicely
When he was away from the one he loved
He sat down and wrote these words

No wind, (no wind) no rain, (no rain)
Nor winter's cold
Can stop me, babe (oh, babe) baby (baby)
If you're my goal
No wind, no rain
Can stop
If you want to go
I know, I know you must follow the sun
Wherever it leads
But remember
If you should fall short of your desires
Remember life holds for you one guarantee
You'll always have me
And if you should miss my love
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms
That used to hold you so close, or the lips
That used to touch yours so tenderly
Just remember what I told you
The day I set you free

Ain't no mountain high enough, aah
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (say it again)

DeBarge,I Like It,"I Like It Lyrics
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, for quite a while
You're on my mind every day and every night

Seem so satisfying to me, I must confess it, girl

When it feels like the world is on your shoulders
And all of the madness has got you going crazy
It's time to get out, step out into the street

DeBarge,A Dream,"A Dream Lyrics
Last night I dreamed
That you were here with me
And we were in each others arms, it was oh so heavenly
You held me close to you and whispered in my ear
""Let's build a life together, share love beyond compare""

As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share (Then the music stopped)
In a flash I was all alone (It was just a dream)
Haunting me once again

A dream, a simple fantasy
That I, wished was reality
That you'd, come knocking at my door
And we'd, relive this dream once more

The day you left, you said you would return
Just when you wouldn't promise, said you needed time alone
You said you loved me and someday our love could be
I couldn't understand it, I thought we were both happy

As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share (Then the music stopped)
In a flash I was all alone (It was just a dream)
Haunting me once again
A dream, a simple fantasy
(A simple fantasy that I)
That I, wished was reality (Oh, oh, that you, ooh)
That you'd, come knocking at my door
(And we'd) And we'd, relive this dream once more
(Oh, oh, oh, a dream, baby)
A dream, a simple fantasy
(It's just a fantasy that I)
That I, wished was reality
(That you'd, come knocking at my door)
Come knocking at my door
(Oh, and we'd) And we'd, relive this dream once more
A dream

Hold me, love me, with all your heart
Oh, oh, come back
Please make my dream come true for me
I need so much for you to see
I need you to love me once again
Oh, oh, oh, oh baby

A dream, a simple fantasy
(Oh)
That I, wished was reality
(I understand it's a fantasy but you)
That you'd, come knocking at my door
(Come knocking at my door)
(Oh, and we'd) And we'd, relive this dream once more
A dream, a simple fantasy
(A dream, a simple fantasy that I wished was reality, oh baby)
That I, wished was reality
(Oh baby, oh)
That you'd, come knocking at my door
And we'd, relive this dream once moreEmbed","The sample used in “I Ain’t Mad At Cha” by 2Pac may be what most recognize about this song today, but it’s a unique song in its own right.

As one of the only DeBarge songs where Bunny takes lead vocals, it’s presumably from a woman’s point of view. Further, it’s one of the more tragic songs in the DeBarge catalogue as the narrator’s hope of reuniting with a former partner is granted each night in a recurring dream. However, each morning she’s jolted into reality only to once again realize that she’s alone in the world and has no one to love or love her. The tragedy is that she may be able to move on to another relationship, but each night the dream retards her progress.","September 24, 1983"

Released in 1994 as the lead single from Mariah Carey’s first holiday album and fourth studio album, Merry Christmas, the song has become established as a Christmas standard. It has sold more than 14 million copies globally since its debut, making it one of the best-selling singles ever. In the US, the song has sold 3.6 million downloads as of 2019.

Over time, countless artists have covered the song, including Miley Cyrus, John Mayer, Shania Twain, Ariana Grande, Fifth Harmony, Demi Lovato, Cee Lo Green, Lady Antebellum and Mumford & Sons.

Mariah herself has re-recorded the song too. In 2011, Carey re-recorded the song as a duet with Justin Bieber. A year later in 2012, Carey recorded a fun version with classroom instruments and children for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

The song’s influence has extended beyond music, too. In 2015, Carey released a book with the same title as her holiday staple, acknowledging the song’s longevity:

When I wrote ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ it was my dream for it to become a classic Christmas song. I am so proud of the song’s impact as it continues to create memories for fans each year. I am thrilled to be able to bring the story of the song to new generations of families with the picture book.

She also released a movie called Mariah Carey’s All I Want For Christmas Is You in 2017.

The song’s legacy remains unparalleled. It charts every holiday season since its original release, and is estimated to have earned Carey $60 million in royalties. The song is also referred to as “the biggest Christmas song of all time”. The song’s immense popularity has earned Mariah the title ‘Queen of Christmas’, a title she isn’t exactly sure about:

I don’t accept that name because I feel like it’s [too much]. I humbly thank them and I do have an extraordinary love for the holiday season, and it is the best time of the year.

After 25 years, the track finally reached No. 1 in Billboard Hot 100, becoming Mariah’s 19th song to do so and making the singer the solo artist with most Billboard Hot 100 chart-toppers. It also sets a new record of the longest run to No. 1 on the chart, surpassing Elton John’s re-recording of “Candle in the Wind.”","November 1, 1994"
Mariah Carey,We Belong Together,"We Belong Together Lyrics
Sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby (We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who else)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
I can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind

Singing to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface, ""I only think of you""
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart

I'm feelin' all out of my element
Throwin' things, cryin'
Tryin' to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)
(We belong together)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby
(We belong together) (Who will?)
When you left, I lost a part of me (Who will?)
It's still so hard to believe (Who will?)
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)

After that, Cannon continued the beef by releasing a diss track, as also challenging the rapper to a boxing match that never actually happened.

It is no strange that the Detroit MC has referenced the New York native superstar multiple times, starting from The Eminem Show cuts like “Superman” and “When The Music Stops” along with the December 2006 track “Jimmy Crack Corn”.
Carey’s “Clown” was the official response to the 2002 subliminals.

Over a decade later, “Obsessed” has saw a renewed interest thanks to a viral TikTok meme of a 13-year old Reese Hardy dancing to the song while sobbing. The singer herself also joined the challenge, when her private car broke down on the way to the Fresh Air Fund-operated Camp Mariah, which she started back in the mid-90’s.

Oh, you’re killing me, you know it ain’t fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh, you’re killing me, baby, do it again, yeah

Always in control, how you do it, I don’t know

The song was written and produced by Carey, Miguel, Nathan Perez, Mac Robinson, Brooke Davis and Brian Keith Warfield.

Mariah told Ryan Seacrest about wanting to work with Miguel on the song – “I’m a huge fan of his music and as I think everybody’s so blown away by him right now.” Alternatively, Miguel has stated that he has loved Mariah ever since she “walked out of the pool in that ‘Honey’ video”.

#Beautiful received positive critical reactions, many of whom praised the idea of a duet between Carey and Miguel. Some even referred to the song as 2013’s ‘song of the summer’.

The song has 5 remix editions, featuring verses from A$AP Rocky to Young Jeezy. Many of these mixes are dance/club remixes. A sixth remix is known to exist, though it was never released by Carey. It is also known to be another dance mix, however.","May 6, 2013"

A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in

My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no

You know you were my first time, a new feel

Frank tries to act tough when reflecting back on a past relationship, but ultimately reveals he still has strong feelings for his ex-lover, and wonders if they have been able to move on or feel the same way he does.

The track was performed on Saturday Night Live, and was also nominated for record of the year in the 2012 Grammys.

Frank Ocean,Nights,"Nights Lyrics

Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (Bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Ooh, nani nani
This feel like a Quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body, ah
New beginnings, ahh
New beginnings, wake up, akh
The sun's goin' down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
Every night shit, every day shit

Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, every day shit
(Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)

All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you're outside
All my night, you been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right

Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up
1998, my family had that Acura
Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions
All the reverends
Preachin' self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'Trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night

Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah

Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by

It also touches upon the events Frank faced while living in Houston after relocating from New Orleans due to Hurricane Katrina. The song’s title is taken from the hook, in which Ocean raps about living a life connected by rough nights.

The song’s structure is divided into two main sides; the first part is rap-heavy, accompanied by pitched up guitar riffs to provide the melody. In the second part the music turns somber and slow, serving as a parallel to a crash after a drug high.

The change in tempo is used to signify the halfway point of the album, playing further into the idea of duality established throughout the album.","August 20, 2016"

Ain't give you no play, mmm

Could I make you shy on the last night, last night?
Could we make it in? Do we have time?

I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair, but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

Now and then, you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights, you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing

Sometimes you'll miss it
And the sound will make you cry
And some nights, you're dancing
With tears in your eyes

Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night

I don't know just where I'm goin'
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
When I put a spike into my vein
And I tell you things aren't quite the same
When I'm rushin' on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I have made big decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life
'Cause when the blood begins to flow
When it shoots up the dropper's neck
When I'm closin' in on death
You can't help me, not you guys
Or all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
You can all go take a walk
And I guess I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Goin' from this land here to that
On a sailor's suit and cap
Away from the big city
Where a man cannot be free
Of all the evils of this town
And of himself and those around
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Heroin, be the death of me
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life, haha
Because a mainline into my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off than dead
Because when the smack begins to flow
I really don't care anymore
About all the Jim-Jims in this town
And all the politicians makin' crazy sounds
And everybody puttin' everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds
'Cause when the smack begins to flow
And I really don't care anymore
Ah, when that heroin is in my blood
Heh, and that blood is in my head
Then thank God that I'm good as dead
And thank your God that I'm not aware
And thank God that I just don't care
And I guess I just don't know
Oh, and I guess I just don't know43Embed","While there are many alternative interpretations of this song, it seems to be the case that Lou Reed was merely describing the effects of the drug, while neither condemning it nor condoning it. It might have been done merely for shock value, or because Reed liked gritty subjects, or as a dark poem of addiction; the beauty of this song is that it works on all of these levels, and many more, at the same time. In many of his songs, we have cases where Lou Reed kept the focus on providing an objective description of the topic without taking a moral stance on thematter.

(From Songfacts)

The desire for something you can’t describe… This is about a guy who is jumping towards God or the perfection of Jesus. There’s a ferocious desire within the song to solve a problem. He doesn’t have much left apart from a desire to score; spiritually he’s bereft, but he thinks if he can get his fix, life will become better. I don’t know if it’s about a specific person, more likely an amalgamation, but it’s a beautiful portrayal of someone at their wits’ end.

– John Cale in an interview with Uncut

Lou Reed wrote “Heroin” while attending Syracuse University – he would have been close to the age of 18.","March 12, 1967"

Sunday morning brings the dawn in
It's just a restless feeling by my side
Early dawning, Sunday morning

There's always someone around you who will call
It's nothing at all

Sunday morning and I'm falling
I've got a feeling I don't want to know
Early dawning, Sunday morning
It's all the streets you crossed not so long ago
Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you who will call
It's nothing at all

There's always someone around you who will call
It's nothing at all

Sunday morning14Embed","“Sunday Morning” is the opening song to The Velvet Underground’s debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico. The song describes the feeling of staying up all Saturday night into Sunday morning. Aptly, Reed & Cale wrote the song after one of those nights at 6 AM on a Sunday morning. As Cale remembered in a 2006 interview with Uncut:

Lou and I had been up all night on crank, as usual, so we decided to visit one of his old Syracuse college pals. Unfortunately, this guy’s upper-middle-class wife didn’t appreciate visits from old college pals high on amphetamines, at 3am, who wanted to play music. He had a guitar which Lou picked up and the evening inspired him to write the song.

The most polished song on the album, “Sunday Morning” was released as a single in December 1966. MGM/Verve spent little, if any effort to promote it and it sunk, unnoticed, on release. However, it grew in popularity through radio play by DJs like John Peel and Dick Summer, sowing the seeds for the Velvets' cult following.

The band made a live version of the song for their last concert with Lou, on the album Live at Max’s Kansas City, where Reed introduces the song with: “This is a song about when you’ve done something so sad and you wake up the next day and you remember it. Not to sound grim or anything… just, once in a while, you have one of those days.”
This can bring another meaning to the song. A song of regret and, maybe, of a new dawn that would represent forgiveness (“[…]always some around you who will call. It’s nothing at all”).","March 12, 1967"

Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather
Whiplash girlchild in the dark
Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Downy sins of streetlight fancies
Chase the costumes she shall wear
Ermine furs adorned, imperious
Severin, Severin awaits you there

I am tired, I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears

Kiss the boot of shiny, shiny leather
Shiny leather in the dark
Tongue of thongs, the belt that does await you
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Severin, Severin, speak so slightly
Severin, down on your bended knee
Taste the whip in love not given lightly
Taste the whip, now bleed for me
I am tired, I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears

The song and its topic challenged songwriting conventions at the time, the celebration of sexual masochism out in the open wasn’t something you heard every day. The word “masochism”, coined by 19th century sexologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing, also comes from Sacher-Masoch’s name, so dude wasn’t kidding around.","March 12, 1967"

Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you

And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare

And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows

92Embed","‘Major Tom’ is a fictional character created by David Bowie for this song in 1969. That same year marked the first moon landing, so space was “in”; this was a year after Stanley Kubrick’s film 2001: A Space Odyssey, co-written with Arthur C. Clarke.

The song is a “lost in space” story, which generated later more songs and sequels about the character by David Bowie (“Ashes to Ashes” and “Hallo Spaceboy”) and even other artists (Peter Schilling’s 1983 “Major Tom (coming home)”, (K.I.A.’s “Mrs Major Tom” and possibly Elton John’s “Rocket Man”. The last one is also produced by Gus Dudgeon, who filled in for Bowie’s usual collaborator Tony Visconti once he refused to work in “Space Oddity” feeling it was a novelty song, a publicity stunt to cash in to the Apollo missions (“this is not ‘Space Oddity’, it’s Ernie The Milkman”).

Many believe that the song describes a drug (heroin) trip, from “lift-off” to “floating” to being “still” with “circuit’s dead” ending in “nothing I can do”.","July 11, 1969"

Though nothing will drive them away

Standing by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day

We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day

But we could be safer just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day84Embed","During his Berlin Period, Bowie spied Tony Visconti kissing backing vocalist Antonia Maaß by the Berlin Wall. Their love was doomed, as Visconti was married.

I thought, of all the places to meet in Berlin, why pick a bench underneath a guard turret on the Wall?

https://youtu.be/VudyGkGWDlc?t=179

Wanting to stop his friend’s affair from coming to his wife’s attention, Bowie anonymised the song, and filled in details from his imagination. As Rolling Stone put it, “Bowie wails with crazed soul about two doomed lovers finding a moment of redemption together — just for one day.”

The song was written with Brian Eno, who plays a droning EMS VCS3. Robert Fripp of King Crimson plays guitar with pitched feedback, whilst Tony Visconti produced Bowie’s finest vocal performance by moving the microphone away from him as the song progressed, forcing him to shout just to be heard.

The song was not initially popular, but is now widely considered one of Bowie’s best. It is frequently played at sporting events and awards ceremonies, and features in many soundtracks in film and television.

It’s believed the track was inspired by German band Neu! whom Bowie was a fan of at the time. Neu! guitarist Michael Rother had been in conversation with Bowie a few times during Bowie’s time in Berlin and they had discussed the possibility of Rother playing on the album, but it didn’t happen due to a miscommunication.","September 23, 1977"

82Embed","“★” (pronounced “Blackstar”) is perhaps Bowie’s most experimental work since 1977’s Low. It contains several total shifts in instrumentation, but whilst images of death crop up repeatedly, the lyrics are abstruse and there are no obvious clues to any story unifying the fragments.

It is the titular first single from Bowie’s 27th  and final studio album, released on the 8th of January 2016. Bowie tragically died only two days later.  Unbeknownst to the world, he had been struggling with liver cancer for 18 months.

The song was originally conceived when Johan Renck asked Bowie to compose the theme music for The Last Panthers, a crime show he was directing. An edited version of the song was released for that purpose, before the single version was officially released in full on the 20th of November 2015. It was accompanied by a music video, full of bizarre imagery, directed by Renck.","November 8, 2015"

Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase

But he thinks he'd blow our minds

Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

It did well as a single in Europe, but appeared only on the album in the US and the UK.

The name of the song is a combination of Meher Baba – an Indian guru who kept silent from 1935 until his death in 1969 and inspired Townshend spiritually, and Terry Riley – a musician and classical composer who also inspired him.

Mistakenly called sometimes “Teenage Wasteland” due to the repeating phrase.

It began with a very long meeting dealing with royalties for his songs: “Eleven hours in the Tin Pan, God, there’s got to be another way.” The “Tin Pan” he is referring to is “Tin Pan Alley” which is the name given to the collection of New York City-centered music publishers and songwriters who dominated the popular music of the United States. After this excruciating meeting he received a large check for royalties, left and went to a bar and got completely drunk. In that bar he encountered Paul Cook and Steve Jones of The Sex Pistols, who thought very highly of Pete for paving the way for Punk rock music. Townshend was conflicted because he feared The Who had sold out, and seeing The Sex Pistols, who were icons of rebellion, exasperated him even more. Pete left that bar and passed out in a random doorway in Soho (a part of New York). A policeman recognized him (“A policeman knew my name”) and being kind, woke him and and told him, “You can go sleep at home tonight (instead of a jail cell), if you can get up and walk away.” Pete’s response: “Who the f–k are you?”

The song would have a popularity resurgence once it became the CSI opening theme.

The fan favorite has stood out for its ideal balance of Morrissey’s irreplaceable voice and lyricism and the ingenious guitar ability of Johnny Marr.","June 16, 1986"
The Smiths,This Charming Man,"This Charming Man Lyrics
Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexity
When the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, ""It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care""

Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, ""Return the ring""
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, ""It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care""

The Smiths,I Know It’s Over,"I Know It’s Over Lyrics
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said

I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over...

Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me
The knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though she needs you more than she loves you

And I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over and over and over and over
Over and over...
I know it's over, and it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said:
""If you're so funny
Then why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very entertaining
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very good-looking
Why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know... 'cause tonight is just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they're in each other's arms...""

It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
Over, over, over, over
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind

But not for you, my love
Not tonight, my love

But not for such as you and I

The Smiths,How Soon Is Now?,"How Soon Is Now? Lyrics

Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular

You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go and you stand on your own, and you leave on your own

Well, when exactly do you mean?
See I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone

It’s most people’s favourite, I think.” Despite its prominent place in The Smiths' repertoire, however, it is not generally considered to be representative of the band’s style.

Although a club favourite, “How Soon Is Now?” did not chart as well as writers Morrissey and Marr had expected. Most commentators put this down to the fact that the song had been out on vinyl in a number of forms before being released as a single in its own right. The original track runs for nearly seven minutes; however, the 7"" single edit cut the length down to under four minutes. The complete version is generally used on compilations. The song has been widely praised for the artistry of its lyrics.

The heavily-reverbed riff that propels the song is a wonderfully repurposed version of Bo Diddley’s “Who Do You Love.”","January 28, 1985"

Black Francis told Esquire

This belongs in the mythological category. I’m less concerned with making sense than making the lyrics pop out of the speaker when people are listening to the music. Some of it is obvious enough to understand, but then ‘If man is five, the devil is six, then God is seven,’ and guess what? That rhymes with ‘Monkey gone to heaven,’ and it’s all a little bit of a mixture of saying things that are real and relevant with a lot of Alice in Wonderland jibber-jabber and gobbledygook.

The single was released on September 7 1994, on what would have been Buddy Holly’s 58th birthday. The song was an international hit, reaching #17 on the US pop charts, and #12 in the UK.

In 2011, Rolling Stone named “Buddy Holly” one of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Despite its popular and critical success, songwriter Rivers Cuomo had little confidence in the song, and had to be prodded by producer Ric Ocasek to include it on the album.

 Bassist Matt Sharp described how hard Ric pushed for the song:

Ric said we’d be stupid to leave it off the album. We’d come into the studio in the morning and find little pieces of paper with doodles on them: “WE WANT BUDDY HOLLY!”

The groundbreaking music video for “Buddy Holly” was filmed by Spike Jonze, later famous for  directing films such as Being John Malkovich and Her.  Jonze digitally inserted the band playing at “Arnold’s” diner from the television show Happy Days, interspersed with footage from the show.

In 2007, Rivers Cuomo released a demo of the song as a part of his solo album Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo.","September 7, 1994"

Frontman Rivers Cuomo has commented on the song to Rolling Stone:

“‘The Sweater Song’ was the first Weezer song I ever wrote, back in 1991,” Cuomo says. “I was trying to write a Velvet Underground-type song because I was super into them, and I came up with that guitar riff. I just picked up that acoustic guitar and the first thing I played was that riff. And it just feels so classic to me, even now when the band starts to play it, it just takes over the energy in the room and you’re just transported into the world of Weezer. It wasn’t until years after I wrote it that I realized it’s almost a complete rip-off of ‘Sanitarium’ by Metallica. It just perfectly encapsulates Weezer to me – you’re trying to be cool like Velvet Underground but your metal roots just pump through unconsciously.

Cuomo has also said {citation needed}:

“Undone” is the feeling you get when the train stops and the little guy comes knockin' on your door. It was supposed to be a sad song, but everyone thinks it’s hilarious.","June 24, 1994"

Despite being on the original demo that got them signed in 1990, their record label chose to hold off on releasing “Linger” as a single until 1993, after both a 1991 EP and a their debut single “Dreams” in 1992 had come out.

It remains the Cranberries only top 10 hit and only gold selling single in the US.

Dolores O'Riordan has said that the song was written about her first boyfriend and “being broken-hearted by a love situation. You love somebody but they reject you”.

Arctic Monkeys,Do I Wanna Know?,"Do I Wanna Know? Lyrics
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay

Arctic Monkeys,505,"505 Lyrics
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with ""Goodbye""
I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs and a smile281Embed","“505” is one of the songs that marks a turning point in Alex Turner’s songwriting, as he discovers new emotional depths.

The organ chords are the same as were used in Ennio Morricone’s soundtrack for the iconic Western, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, where Angel Eyes enters before the final standoff.

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, aren't as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging 'till I'm getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go? Where did you go?

You're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
Just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again
You're falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You were just sounding it out
But you're not coming back again

Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness

The song is one of the band’s most popular and a concert staple.

The writing of this is co-credited to Johanna Bennett, Alex Turner’s ex-girlfriend. The song’s roots lie in a Mediterranean holiday Turner and Bennett took during which they were reminiscing about characters they knew at school, as he recalled in The Times magazine in 2007 (documented by NME magazine):

It started off as a joke. Then it were like, “Here’s another verse.” We were having a laugh. Some of the lines were hers. I couldn’t have not credited her. It’s just right, really.

As documented by NME magazine, Johanna herself said during an interview for The Observer that:


We were on holiday and had cut ourselves off from everything. We were in a really quiet hotel and didn’t watch TV or listen to that much music… So as not to drive each other mad we started messing around with these words like game, singing them to each other.

It’s great to think that it came from something we did for fun on holiday. It’ll always be a good memory for Alex and I. He doesn’t usually write lyrics with other people, though I think he enjoyed it.","July 4, 2007"

one of a classic style of love poem, love song, in which the writer expresses his desire to be useful to the object of his desire.

The beat is strongly reminiscent of “Spanish Sahara.”

During a 2011 Rolling Stone interview, Foster said:

I was trying to get inside the head of an isolated, psychotic kid.

Although this song is peppy and upbeat, Foster uses this to mask the true meaning of the song, and makes for a beautiful yet haunting composition, a tension which he referenced in the same interview:

It’s a ‘fuck you’ song to the hipsters in a way – but it’s a song the hipsters are going to want to dance to.

Despite many believing that this song condones and encourages violence, Foster said otherwise in a 2011 USA Today interview:

The song is not about condoning violence at all. It’s the complete opposite. The song is an amazing platform to have a conversation with your kids about something that shouldn’t be ignored, to talk about it in a loving way.","October 14, 2010"

First, it is a notable example of early metal, known in retrospect as “stoner metal” due to its psychedelic traits. Other “stoner” bands include Iron Butterfly and Black Sabbath.

Second, instead of the response lyrics of the Cochrane and Who versions, this version features “mini solos” performed by each member of the band.

Find out I can make it new

Black Sabbath,Paranoid,"Paranoid Lyrics

Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long, I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me occupy my brain?
Whoa, yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind


Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so, as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could, but it's too late51Embed","This song by Black Sabbath is consistently ranked as one of the greatest heavy metal songs of all time. Maybe the biggest hit of Ozzy’s group, along with “Iron Man.”

The lyrics were written by and about bassist Geezer Butler, whom the band often called paranoid, even though he didn’t know what the word meant. They are about Butler’s feelings as a depressed teenager and him thinking he was going insane.

According to the band, the song only took 20 minutes to write. It was supposed to be just a filler song and the album was supposed to be called War Pigs. When they released it as a single and it got very popular, however, the record label wanted them to name the album Paranoid.","September 18, 1970"
Black Sabbath,Iron Man,"Iron Man Lyrics
I am Iron Man

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or, if he moves, will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again

Black Sabbath,War Pigs,"War Pigs Lyrics

Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields, the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh, Lord, yeah

Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor, yeah
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah

Now, in darkness, world stops turning
Ashes where their bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment, God is calling
On their knees, the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
Oh, Lord, yeah
52Embed","As the opening track of the influential Black Sabbath album, Paranoid, “War Pigs” was originally titled “Walpurgis.” Walpurgis Night takes place on the 30th April to mark the eve of the feast day of Saint Walpurga, an 8th-century English missionary to the Frankish Empire. It is also believed to be the night of a witches’ meeting or sabbath. The instrumental outro is entitled, “Luke’s Wall.”

The song talks about war and—like the hippies—Black Sabbath was totally against it, specifically the Vietnam War (occurring at the time), and although Geezer Butler has stated that:

[“War Pigs” is] totally against the Vietnam War, about how these rich politicians and rich people start all the wars for their benefit and get all the poor people to die for them.

And in an interview with Mojo in 2017:

Britain was on the verge of being brought into it, there was protests in the street, all kinds of anti-Vietnam things going on. War is the real Satanism. Politicians are the real Satanists. That’s what I was trying to say.

Ozzy Osbourne has said that:

[The group] knew nothing about Vietnam. It’s just an anti-war song.","September 18, 1970"

Butler later referred to it as

Ozzy and Iommi also stated that

the title has nothing to do with the content of the song.

Led Zeppelin,Stairway to Heaven,"Stairway to Heaven Lyrics

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, it  makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the West
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

Oh-oh-oh-oh-woahhh

It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder
Ohh, woah

Your head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one, and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven280Embed","“Stairway to Heaven” is one of Led Zeppelin’s most famous recordings, with many considering it the greatest rock song of all time. It tells the story of a greedy woman who is overly optimistic about her unpromising future.

The song resonated with young listeners, opening up a door to a different realm of spirituality and transporting them into a more mystical view of life. The vagueness of the lyrics also allows listeners to interpret the song in their own way, adding to the magic and mystery of the track.","November 8, 1971"

Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war

The lyrics, as explained by Robert Plant and documented by Wikipedia, are influenced by the band visiting Iceland, a land first settled by Vikings:

We weren’t being pompous (about the song)… We did come from the land of the ice and snow. We were guests of the Icelandic Government on a cultural mission. We were invited to play a concert in Reykjavik and the day before we arrived all the civil servants went on strike and the gig was going to be cancelled. The university prepared a concert hall for us and it was phenomenal. The response from the kids was remarkable and we had a great time. ‘Immigrant Song’ was about that trip and it was the opening track on the album that was intended to be incredibly different.","October 5, 1970"

The whole inspiration came from the fact that the road went on and on and on. It was a single-track road which neatly cut through the desert. Two miles to the East and West were ridges of sandrock. It basically looked like you were driving down a channel, this dilapidated road, and there was seemingly no end to it.

“Kashmir” is both a fan favorite and a live staple that was played at nearly every concert after its release. It features one of the most memorable LZ riffs.","February 24, 1975"

Embed","The song was written by Paul Stanley and Bob Ezrin and is about a real Kiss fan who was killed in a car accident on his way to a Kiss concert.

Song information:
The song, recorded and released as a single in 1976, was the third single from Kiss’s album Destroyer and was planned to be their last in support of the album. As a single, it did poorly in sales and radio play (other than in Detroit), and failed to chart in the U.S. even though it would prove to be a fan favorite. It came as a surprise that the B-side “Beth”, a ballad written and sung by drummer Peter Criss, wound up catching on in different markets in the United States, so the single was reissued with “Beth” as the A-side and “Detroit Rock City” as the B-side.

During the Love Gun/Alive II tour, Stanley changed the lyric, “I know I’m gonna die, why?” to “I know I’m gonna die, and I don’t care!” The song was #6 on VH1’s 40 Greatest Metal Songs and is featured on the album Heavy Metal – The First 20 Years. “Detroit Rock City” was based on an earlier song that Kiss performed only in concert called “Acrobat”.

The radio voice over at the start if the song is actually Gene Simmons.

Personnel:
Paul Stanley – lead vocals/rhythm guitar/backing vocals.
Ace Frehley – lead guitar.
Gene Simmons – bass guitar/backing vocals.
Peter Criss – drums.","July 28, 1976"
Iron Maiden,The Number of the Beast,"The Number of the Beast Lyrics
Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty-six

I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think, to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cos in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah

Night was black, was no use holding back
Cos I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real, or just some kind of hell?

Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done

Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid the eyes

Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Six-six-six, the one for you and me

I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course15Embed","This song was the band’s second single from their 1982 album. It was influenced by the 1978 horror movie Damien: Omen II, which is about the 13-year-old Antichrist. It is one of Iron Maiden’s most famous and one of heavy metal’s most recognizable songs.

Basically, this song is about a dream. It’s not about devil worship.

—Steve Harris

The song starts with a quote from the Bible, read by British actor Barry Clayton; the first lines from Revelations 12:12 and the last three from Revelations 13:8. The band wanted the horror film actor Vincent Price to read this intro, but he wanted more money than they were willing to pay.

During the recording of the album, there were rumors floating about that supernatural occurrences had been going on in the studio, such as lights flipping on and off, strange noises and visions of Satan, that culminated in a car accident their producer Martin Birch was involved, the bill of which was 666 GBP. This was used as evidence that Satan and the Antichrist had a hand in making this. Many preachers and enemies of rock music were led to believe Maiden were Satanists because of the song’s title. Steve Harris replied: “They completely got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn’t read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists.”

Bruce Dickinson’s high-pitched scream at the end of the intro was a result of producer Martin Birch forcing the band to replay the intro several times. Dickinson became so fed up with the constant repeats that he emitted the scream out of frustration, and it fit so well that the band decided to keep it.","March 22, 1982"
Iron Maiden,Fear of the Dark,"Fear of the Dark Lyrics
I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear
That something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared
To take a look, at the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear
That something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear
That something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks alone23Embed","The title track from Iron Maiden’s last album with lead singer Bruce Dickinson before his seven-year departure from the band, “Fear of the Dark” can be straightforwardly interpreted as a song about nyctophobia, and by extension whatever hides in darkness. The dark can also be more broadly interpreted as anything unknown or unfamiliar to someone that inspires in them fear and anxiety.

Steve [Harris], who wrote it, is really afraid of the dark. It’s the story of a man who walks in a park at night and, as it’s getting darker, he sees all sorts of worrying things. He becomes totally paranoid ‘cause his imagination is working overtime. It’s a great track.

—Bruce Dickinson



The song also sees more crowd participation than most other Iron Maiden songs. During live concerts, fans and spectators will often sing along to the guitar intro as well as the instrumental interlude.","May 11, 1992"
Iron Maiden,The Trooper,"The Trooper Lyrics
You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there, gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh29Embed","“The Trooper” tells of the futile heroism of a British soldier during the Charge of the Light Brigade, a light infantry manoeuvre during the Battle of Balaclava (1854) that was famously retold in Tennyson’s poem.

The poem was written 6 weeks after the event, reaching the British troops still fighting in the Crimean War (1853-1856), where it became an inspiring tribute.

The song was the second single released from Piece of Mind, and at the time was famous for its MTV banned music video, which depicted scenes from the 1936 Errol Flynn movie, in which actual horses died.

The song itself has since inspired Iron Maiden’s own beer:



And the Eddie from the single cover is even stamped on the arm of the song’s composer, Steve Harris.","May 16, 1983"
Iron Maiden,Hallowed Be Thy Name,"Hallowed Be Thy Name Lyrics
I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
Cos at five o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
Take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears fall, but why am I crying?
After all, I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?


As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell, ""God be with you""
If there's a God, why has He let me go?
As I walk, my life drifts before me
And though the end is near, I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away
Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hallowed be thy name
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hallowed be thy name
Yeah23Embed","This song is the somber reflections of a prisoner on the day his death sentence is to be carried out. The listener is given no context regarding the prisoner’s crime (could he be the narrator from several of the tracks on Killers?), but is instead treated to an introspective look at the meaning of life.

The title of the song, “Hallowed Be Thy Name,” comes from The Lord’s Prayer (exact text of the prayer varies by denomination).

Our Father, who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,
On Earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation
And deliver us from evil



The prisoner initially confronts his fear and dread at the prospect of his death by hanging, but remembers his beliefs. At first he scorns the idea of God, then he takes comfort in the idea of a higher power taking him in upon death, and ends up with a realization that life on Earth isn’t really important.

Several of this song’s lines were lifted from British prog band Beckett’s 1974 track “Life’s Shadow” by Steve Harris. The Iron Maiden bassist saw Beckett perform in 1973 and their debut LP was one of his favorite albums when it was first released. He initially used the lyrics as a placeholder and did not have time to change them before Number of the Beast was released.
After Beckett’s retired band manager Barry McKay filed a lawsuit, £100,000 (approximately $138,000) was paid by Iron Maiden out of court to “Life’s Shadow” songwriters Brian Quinn and Robert Barton.

This song quickly became one of Iron Maiden’s most acclaimed works, with several bands recording covers of it. This song may have helped inspire Metallica’s similarly themed Ride The Lightning.","March 22, 1982"

133Embed","On their controversial self-titled album which came to be known as the Black Album, “Nothing Else Matters” was perhaps the greatest example of the new Metallica sound that alienated core fans. Frontman James Hetfield had been taking classical guitar lessons and wanted to show off his fingerpicking skills in the introduction. The song grew out of an extension of a phone call James made with his girlfriend while on tour and he was picking his guitar while on the phone.

While the song does get heavy during the second guitar solo, it is for the most part, a ballad about expressing your feelings, like an Emerson poem:

It was a song for myself in my room on tour when I was bumming out about being away from home. It’s quite amazing, it’s a true testament to honesty and exposing yourself, putting your real self out there, and taking the risk, taking a gamble that someone’s either going to step on your heart with spikes on or they’re going to put their heart right next to it, and you never know until you try. That solidified, I think, that we were doing the right thing, writing from the heart about what we felt, and you can’t go wrong that way.

“Nothing Else Matters” has become a song that any complete beginner who has never picked up a guitar can feel like they are playing Metallica for a few measures.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAGnKpE4NCI

Famed Hollywood composer Michael Kamen contributed an orchestrated part, which was mixed somewhat low in the song. To compensate, years later Metallica did the S&M concert and album with Kamen conducting the San Francisco Symphony, with “Nothing Else Matters” being a centerpiece and single.","August 12, 1991"
Metallica,One,"One Lyrics

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me


Now, the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, help me

Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself, body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell
126Embed","The fourth track on Metallica’s classic, …And Justice for All, is based on the novel Johnny Got His Gun by Dalton Trumbo. There, Joe Bonham, a soldier in World War I, is hit by a landmine explosion that takes away his limbs and face, and becomes a prisoner in his own body – Joe lost his senses and can’t communicate, but is still kept alive by the medical crew. Thus the lyrics follow his plea to be put out of his misery.

A specific passage that inspired the song is:

How could a man lose as much of himself as I have and still live? When a man buys a lottery ticket you never expect him to win because it’s a million to one shot. But if he does win, you’ll believe it because one in a million still leaves one. If I’d read about a guy like me in the paper I wouldn’t believe it, cos it’s a million to one. But a million to ONE always leaves one. I’d never expect it to happen to me because the odds of it happening are a million to one. But a million to one always leaves one. One.

“One” marked the first time Metallica did a music video for their songs. The video featured footage from the film adaptation of Johnny Got His Gun directed by Trumbo himself, which the band bought the rights for to make incorporating it easier.

The song follows the theme of childhood fear, in nightmares, with the eponymous Sandman symbolizing the sleep that he dreads.  However, the Sandman of European folklore actually represents the bringer of good dreams.

In 2007, drummer Lars Ulrich told Uncut:

‘Enter Sandman’ was the first thing we came up with when we sat down for the songwriting process in July 1990. The 10-minute, 12-tempo-changes side of Metallica had run its course. We wanted to streamline and simplify things. We wrote the song in a day or two. All the bits of ‘Enter Sandman’ are derived from the main riff.

Meanwhile, James Hetfield told Uncut:

I wanted more of the mental thing where this kid gets manipulated by what adults say. You know when you wake up with that shit in your eye? That’s supposedly been put in there by the sandman to make you dream. So the guy in the song tells this little kid that and he kinda freaks. He can’t sleep after that and it works the opposite way. Instead of a soothing thing, the table’s turned.

Twenty years after the song’s release, producer Bob Rock shared the original concept of the song’s lyrics with Music Radar:

At first, based on the music and the riff, the band and their management thought it could be the first single. Then they heard James’ lyrics and realized the song was about crib death. That didn’t go over well. I sat down with James and talked to him about his words. I told him, ‘What you have is great, but it can be better. Does it have to be so literal?’ Not that I was thinking about the single; I just wanted him to make the song great. It was a process, him learning to say what he wanted but in a more poetic and open sort of way. He rewrote some lyrics and it was all there… the first single.","August 12, 1991"

I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life
Forced in, like cattle you run
Stripped of
Your life's worth
Human mice, for the angel of death
Four hundred thousand more to die

Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead

Sadistic, surgeon of demise
Sadist of the noblest blood
Destroying, without mercy
To benefit the Aryan race
Surgery, with no anesthesia
Feel the knife pierce you intensely
Inferior, no use to mankind
Strapped down, screaming out to die
Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of death

Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh drips away
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
Frigid cold cracks your limbs
How long can you last
In this frozen water burial?
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time
'Till you rip yourselves apart

Millions laid out in their
Crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve
The Holocaust

Seas of blood, bury life
Smell your death as it burns
Deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of
Your wide awake nightmare
Wings of pain, reach out for you
His face of death staring down
Your blood's running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of
The mutants he's creating
Pathetic harmless victims
Left to die
Rancid angel of death
Flying free

Trapped in purgatory
A lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal
Death will be their acquittance
The sky is turning red
Return to power draws near
Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears
Abolish the rules made of stone

Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above

Awaiting the hour of reprisal
Your time slips away

Raining blood
From a lacerated sky
Bleeding its horror
Creating my structure
Now, I shall reign in blood

Writers Kerry King and the late Jeff Hanneman have said it’s one of their favorite songs to play live, and it has been an almost permanent fixture in their live set lists for more than 30 years. Often, they perform in the midst of a rain of stage blood.



According to D.X. Ferris' book Reign in Blood, Hanneman explained,

It’s about a guy who’s in Purgatory ‘cause he was cast out of Heaven. He’s waiting for revenge and wants to fuck that place up.

King added,

The rest of the song explains what happens when he starts fucking people up. The lyrics ‘Return to power draws near’ is because he’s waiting to get strong enough again to overthrow Heaven. And then ‘Fall into me, the sky’s crimson tears’ is everybody’s blood flowing into him. So basically, ‘Raining Blood’ is all the angels' blood falling on him.","October 7, 1986"

Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

Oh, oh

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same

And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!
Put me back together or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!

All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane!
All I've got, all I've got is insane!
All I've got, all I've got is insane!
All I've got, all I've got is insane!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane!
All I've got, all I've got is insane!58Embed","“Duality” was the 1st single from Slipknot’s 3rd album, Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses, and was released on May 25, 2004. It was produced by Rick Rubin.

It peaked at #5 on the US Rock Chart and reached #15 in the UK, where it remains their highest-charting song. In 2019, Billboard named it the band’s best song.

The music video was shot at a fan’s house, resulting in Roadrunner Records paying the fan’s family $50,000 for damages incurred in the shoot.



According to Corey Taylor:

“Duality” is about standing at the crossroads of your life, looking down both paths, and going, “Now what am I going to do?” Did you ever get that headache that is just not going to go away, and you end up sticking your thumb and middle finger so far into your eyes, just to stop the pain? It usually has to do with making a choice. You get to that point in everyday life when you have to make a decision that you may not want to, but you’re kind of pushed into that position. ""

Like all of the songs on “Vol. 3…”, Duality contains NO explicit lyrics, and was the first Slipknot single that was released without requiring a clean radio version.

It is also important for the entire album to remember that this is the album where Corey Taylor went sober and Clown dawned his “healing” mask.","May 4, 2004"
Slipknot,Unsainted,"Unsainted Lyrics
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I'll never kill myself to save my soul)
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I didn't come this far to sink so low)
I'm finally holding on to letting go

I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
Myopic, cannot see straight
Dystopic, one sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting
Go

Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me
You've killed the saint in me
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?61Embed","“Unsainted” is the first single being released from Slipknot’s album We Are Not Your Kind. The track talks about depression, as vocalist Corey Taylor has suffered from it for many years, but he’s “finally holding on to letting go.”

I do have bouts of severe depression, which are very, very hard to deal with sometimes. […] So I’ve really tried to deal with it as naturally as possible, and I know that sounds very hippie-like, but when you know yourself, and you know the habits that you can slip into so easily, you have to find alternatives. […]

—Corey Taylor, Rolling Stone

The music video for the song shows the band’s new masks, succeeding 2014’s .5: The Gray Chapter masks. The track was teased on the band’s official pages with three videos with captions featuring the song’s lyrics but with no sound snippets.



When talking about the album in 2018, Corey Taylor said what completely represents this track:

It’s complicated, it’s dark, it’s heavy, it’s heavy, it’s melodic, it’s fierce, it’s angry and it’s raw as hell. It’s going to be talking about a lot of things that people are going to need in their life.

Musically, the song mixes the heaviness of 2001’s Iowa in the verses with the melody and commercial side of 2008’s All Hope Is Gone in the chorus.","May 16, 2019"

I cry when angels deserve to die167Embed","Rick Rubin, who produced Toxicity for System of a Down, cites this song as one of his most important projects. He told Rolling Stone:

This song was originally going to be called “Self-Righteous Suicide,” and the record company rebelled. I remember wanting to go to the mat and keep the title, and the band decided, “Let’s call it ‘Chop Suey!’” which I thought was kind of funny.

Chop-suey is the Americanization of the Chinese quick dish tsap sui, which means “odds and ends, mixed bits” in the Cantonese dialect. The song title is a play on “Self-right-Chop Suey-cide,” that has a further sort of humor in that they mixed up a controversial word into a nonsensical word to create a more ‘radio-friendly’ title.

The song enjoyed success, climbing the charts after its August 2001 release before virtually disappearing from airwaves after 9/11. The song’s chorus, with its congratulatory “self-righteous suicide,” and lament, “I cry when angels deserve to die” was considered a bit too raw for listeners at the time. In the wake of the tragedy, Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) put out a memo to its subsidiary radio stations  temporarily blackballing (but not outright banning) it, along with 164 other “lyrically questionable” songs. Eventually, the record resurfaced on the charts—in part due to its earlier popularity, in part due to the lack of new singles released that September. However, it remains one of System of a Down’s worst performing US singles, particularly relative to the song’s global performance.

Although the lyrics are viewed as confrontational, the singer is actually challenging the listener to “wake up” and reconsider the way that they judge and deride people who are engaged in self-destructive behaviors. The song culminates in a biblical connection to Jesus before his death on the cross, with the singer ostensibly having chosen his “self-righteous suicide” so that these ‘sinners’ would be forgiven.","August 13, 2001"

We're one in the river and one again after the fall
Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves, but we find it all

Always wanna go, but you never wanna stay
And we are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play, but you never wanna lose

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life

Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river then we turn around and put up our walls
Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves, but we find it all

Always wanna go, but you never wanna stay

It was critically and commercially successful; the song was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 2003 Grammy Awards.

Although Daron Malakian said in some shows that “Aerials” doesn’t mean anything, the overall theme of the song is our mistaken views of ourselves as being individual and isolated from the rest and how we actually are a tiny part of something greater, from which we come when we are born, and to which we go when we die. It speaks of clinging to life and not accepting death, because we see death as an ending, not as another step of existence. When we die, our matter is decomposed and is transferred to things like worms that feed on us, to the atmosphere in the form of gas, and to the ground and plants that feed on him. We are always moving through the circle of existence, there is no stillness, only movement, and transformation.

On many CD issues, “Aerials” is listed as a single track with a length of 6:11. In reality, “Aerials” itself ends at around 3:54, while the rest of the length is taken up by a hidden track unofficially named “Arto.”","September 4, 2001"

McCartney dreamed the entire melody before he arranged the music with George Martin. According to Rolling Stone:

‘It fell out of bed,’ Paul McCartney once said about the origins of ‘Yesterday.’ ‘I had a piano by my bedside, and I must have dreamed it, because I tumbled out of bed and put my hands on the piano keys and I had a tune in my head. It was just all there, a complete thing. I couldn’t believe it. It came too easy.’

The working lyrics Paul used to fit the tune before he wrote the actual words started with “Scrambled eggs / Oh my baby how I love your legs / Not as much as I love scrambled eggs.” Picking up on that famous trivia, Jimmy Fallon eventually developed the rest of “Scrambled eggs” and recorded it with Paul.","September 13, 1965"

It’s been suggested that each verse talks about one of the members of The Beatles or a self-portrait of Lennon himself. However, by his own admission, Lennon often simply filled his lyrics with non-sequiturs:

The thing was created in the studio. It’s gobbledygook; Come Together was an expression that Leary had come up with for his attempt at being president or whatever he wanted to be, and he asked me to write a campaign song. I tried and tried, but I couldn’t come up with one. But I came up with this, Come Together, which would’ve been no good to him – you couldn’t have a campaign song like that, right?

John Lennon stated that he thought the song was written as a form of blessing from Paul McCartney for his and Yoko’s relationship. They were touched by McCartney’s act and Cynthia said she would always remember his “gesture of care and concern in coming to see us.”



While it was being recorded, producer George Martin voiced his discontent with the abnormal song length. Coming in at over seven minutes long–with four of those minutes comprising the outro–Martin expressed the opinion that radio DJs would not play the song. Lennon responded with: “They will if it’s us.”

Once released, the song performed absolutely fantastically. With its seven-minute runtime, it became the longest single to top the British music charts in its day. In the United States, the song spent nine weeks at #1, making it the best-performing Beatles single. Additionally, at the time it tied for the record of longest-sitting chart-topping single.

The reaction to the song did not wane. It stayed as The Beatles' best performing U.S. single and is considered by many music critics as being one of the best songs of all time. Rolling Stone lists it at #8. It sits at #10 on Billboard’s 55th Anniversary countdown. In addition, the song is the most referenced musical performance.","August 26, 1968"

He documents events through history that could be seen as “works of the devil.” The Rolling Stones took some serious heat for singing a song from the devil’s perspective, but the point of the song is more about the flaws in mankind. It was never intended as devil worship.

There was a rumor that this song was playing when a fan died at the Rolling Stones gig at the Altamont Free Concert, but it was actually “Under My Thumb.” Despite that, the Stones didn’t perform this song for at least 5 years (as they played it on tour in 1975) after the incident.

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
I wanna see your face, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black

Keith Richards, in his book Life on Jagger’s lyrics writing process:

They started running down Brown Sugar the first night, but they didn’t get a take. I watched Mick write the lyrics. It took him maybe forty-five minutes; it was disgusting. He wrote it down as fast as he could move his hand. I’d never seen anything like it. He had one of those yellow legal pads, and he’d write a verse a page, just write a verse and then turn the page, and when he had three pages filled, they started to cut it. It was amazing!""

The song is thought to have been inspired by soul singer Claudia Lennear, who was also the inspiration behind David Bowie’s “Lady Grinning Soul”.

There are several different ways to interpret this song. The most straightforward is a meditation on white male on black female sex  and how power has influenced it. Alternatively it could be more generally about interracial sex or black sex. Finally, as meta-fiction: Mick Jagger plunders the musical history of black people from slave rhythms, to spirituals, to blues, to honky tonk. And further is willing to proudly crow about how tempting and good they are.

The first reading is probably what was intended, but given the rollicking rock, the final is not inappropriate whether intended or not.","April 16, 1971"

41Embed","“Gimme Shelter” is the opening track of the Rolling Stones’s 1969 album Let It Bleed (where it was actually spelled “Gimmie Shelter”, but the more accurate spelling was adopted afterwards).

It paints a bleak world view inspired by the Vietnam war, as put by Mick Jagger:

“Well, it’s a very rough, very violent era. The Vietnam War. Violence on the screens, pillage and burning. And Vietnam was not war as we knew it in the conventional sense. The thing about Vietnam was that it wasn’t like World War II, and it wasn’t like Korea, and it wasn’t like the Gulf War. It was a real nasty war, and people didn’t like it. People objected, and people didn’t want to fight it…” As for the song itself, he concluded, “That’s a kind of end-of-the-world song, really. It’s apocalypse; the whole record’s like that.”

However, the song’s inspiration was not Vietnam or social unrest, but Keith Richards seeing people scurrying for shelter from a sudden London rainstorm.
“I had been sitting by the window of my friend Robert Fraser’s apartment on Mount Street in London with an acoustic guitar when suddenly the sky went completely black and an incredible monsoon came down. It was just people running about looking for shelter — that was the germ of the idea. We went further into it until it became, you know, rape and murder are ‘just a shot away’.”

The female vocals were sung by session singer Merry Clayton. Jagger explained in the 2003 book According To… The Rolling Stones:

The use of the female voice was producer Jimmy Miller’s idea. It would be one of those moments along the lines of ‘I hear a girl on this track – get one on the phone.’ Clayton, pregnant at the time, reportedly suffered a miscarriage soon after the session.

On the 1969, 1972 and 1975 U.S. tours as a straight ahead hard rock song without female accompaniment, it didn’t return to the setlist until 1989 when Clayton’s vocal turn usually went to Lisa Fischer. The 50th anniversary tour had some special appearances by Lady Gaga (New Jersey), Florence Welch (London) and Mary J. Blige (also London ). Grace Potter also had the honors in 2015.

U.S. President Barack Obama told Rolling Stone in an interview while campaigning for his first term that the Stones were one his musical heroes (along with Stevie Wonder) and “Gimme Shelter” was his favourite Stones song.

Gimme Shelter* is also the title to the Maysles brothers' 1970 documentary film of the Stones' 1969 U.S. tour climaxing with the infamous Altamont concert near San Francisco.","December 5, 1969"

The song was famously used in the iconic opening scene of Francis Ford Coppola’s 1979 film Apocalypse Now, with images of the Vietnam War to the cinematic battle towards the end of the movie between Willard (Martin Sheen’s character) and Kurtz (Marlon Brando’s character).

In a 1969 interview with Rolling Stone, Morrison said the song means something different every time he listened to it:

It started out as a simple good-bye song… Probably just to a girl, but I see how it could be a goodbye to a kind of childhood. I really don’t know. I think it’s sufficiently complex and universal in its imagery that it could be almost anything you want it to be.

Several musical influences are apparent in Robby Krieger’s composition of this song, including Chopin’s “Funeral March.”","January 4, 1967"

This evolved out of a jam session when the band was messing around with “Ghost Riders In The Sky,” a cowboy song by Stan Jones. It was Jim Morrison’s idea to alter the title to “Riders On The Storm.”

Ray Manzarek used the electric piano to create the effect of rain.

If you listen closely, you can hear Jim Morrison whispering the lyrics over his own singing, which causes a kind of creepy effect.

This was Morrison’s final contribution as a rock star. Ray Manzarek told Uncut magazine September 2011: “There’s a whisper voice on ‘Riders on the Storm,’ if you listen closely, a whispered overdub that Jim adds beneath his vocal. That’s the last thing he ever did. An ephemeral, whispered overdub.”

The single was shortened for radio play. Some of the piano solo was cut out.

Snoop Dogg covered the song for the 2004 game, Need for Speed: Underground 2, in a remixed version produced by Fredwreck. The cover was dubbed over the original track.

Light My Fire was their first top charting hit, succeeding first as an LP track, then shortened by more than 4 minutes, and issued as a single. The song is consistently featured in various “greatest songs ever” lists, landing #35 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

The song perfectly combines Jim Morrison’s powerful voice with Robby Krieger’s guitar playing, and Ray Manzarek’s iconic organ riff and solo.

Ray Manzarek said in an interview with NPR about the song, but it was true for the whole album:

We were aware of Muddy Waters. We were aware of Howlin' Wolf and John Coltrane and Miles Davis. Plus, Jan and Dean and The Beach Boys and the surf sound. Robby Krieger brings in some flamenco guitar. I bring a little bit of classical music along with the blues and jazz, and certainly John Densmore was heavy into jazz. And Jim brings in beatnik poetry and French symbolist poetry, and that’s the blend of The Doors as the sun is setting into the Pacific Ocean at the end, the terminus of Western civilization. That’s the end of it. Western civilization ends here in California at Venice Beach, so we stood there inventing a new world on psychedelics.","April 1, 1967"

Drummer John Densmore recalled the moment in his 1991 biography, Riders on the Storm: My Life with Jim Morrison and The Doors:

[Morrison said] ‘Yeah, I feel really good about this one. It just came to me all of a sudden […] in a flash—as I was sitting up there on the ridge looking out over the city.’ His eyes were wild with excitement. ‘I scribbled it down as fast as I could. It felt great to be writing again.’ He looked down at the crumpled paper in his hand and sang the chorus in his haunting blues voice.

Morrison and Krieger are credited with writing the song. It reached #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 in October 1967.","September 1, 1967"

And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense

I am sure of it

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?


How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here
203Embed","“Wish You Were Here” is the title track on Pink Floyd’s 1975 album. The song’s lyrics encompass writer Roger Waters‘ feelings of alienation from other people, drawing particular inspiration from his old friend Syd Barrett, the founder of Pink Floyd  who left the band due to mental health issues. The song forms part of a concept album focusing on absence and disenchantment with the music industry. The song “Shine on you Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-9)” was already an homage to Syd, while this one also grieves his absence. The other two songs on the album (“Welcome to the Machine” and “Have a Cigar”) express the band’s newfound distaste for the pressures of the music industry, pressures that they feel helped cause Syd to crack, thus tying the album together as a coherent piece.  David Gilmour and Roger Waters collaborated to write the music.

This was a rare case of the Pink Floyd primary songwriters Roger Waters and David Gilmour mutually collaborating on a song – they rarely wrote together. Gilmour had the opening riff written and was playing it in the studio at a fast pace when Roger Waters heard it and asked him to play it slower. The song built from there, with the pair writing the music for the chorus and verses together, and Waters adding the lyrics.

The song reflected the feeling of the band while they were recording the album. Waters felt they were not putting a full effort into the recording sessions.

When this song starts, it sounds like it is coming from an AM radio somewhere in the distance. It represents the distance between the listener and the music.

At 42 seconds, you can also hear Richard Wright cough. When he heard the song later, it inspired him to quit smoking.

While not a single upon release, it earned this status with a version recorded on the live album Pulse, where the cover depicted two lost souls staring into fish bowls.","September 12, 1975"
Pink Floyd,Time,"Time Lyrics
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells147Embed","This is the only track on the album that credits all 4 members of the band. It’s about how time can slip by, but many people do not realize it until it is too late. Roger Waters got the idea when he realized he was no longer preparing for anything in life, but was right in the middle of it at the age of 29.

The idea in “Time” is a similar exhortation to “Breathe.” To be here now, this is it. Make the most of it.

—Roger Waters

Doris Troy, Lesley Duncan, Liza Strike, and Barry St John sang on backing vocals, which were processed through an early pitch-changing device called a Frequency Translator.

“Part 1” had come two tracks earlier, and even the immediately preceding song, “The Happiest Days of Our Lives” was thematically similar, to the point where one radio edit combines both songs.

David Gilmour credits producer Bob Ezrin for the song’s disco sound:

He said to me, “Go to a couple of clubs and listen to what’s happening with disco music,” so I forced myself out and listened to loud, four-to-the-bar bass drums and stuff and thought, Gawd, awful! Then we went back and tried to turn one of the “Another Brick in the Wall” parts into one of those so it would be catchy. We did the same exercise on “Run Like Hell.”

But Roger Waters is more reluctant to embrace the disco classification:

The song ran slow, almost like a chant or mantra, at 100 beats per minute. To give it a bit of punch, Bob Ezrin added a kick drum on every beat, which made the song a different animal than something strummed on an acoustic guitar. It’s not a disco beat, as many people have said, but more of a heart beat. It’s very cool.","November 23, 1979"

No wonder it’s their usual setlist opener (except in the Chinese Democracy tour, where the eponymous song did the honors) and a mainstay of many sports events.

According to an interview published by Hit Parader in March 1988:

Axl wrote the words while visiting his long-time friend Tori in Kingston, Washington, a town outside of Seattle. It’s a big city, but at the same time, it’s still a small city compared to Los Angeles and the things that you’re gonna learn. It seemed a lot more rural up there. Axl just wrote how it looked to him. If someone comes to town and they want to find something, they can find whatever they want.

There has been said that Axl and a friend heard the exact same phrase that is used in the song from the lips of a homeless man, as soon as they climbed down from a bus, just after arriving in New York:

You know where you are?
You’re in the jungle, babe

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah...

'Cause nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah

Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

Clocking in at almost 9 minutes, “November Rain” features Rose’s desperate vocal and heartfelt piano. A depressing autumn tale of lost love, Slash’s inspired soaring guitar solos and the band’s dramatic dynamics over a crescendo of a swirling string section backed by a powerful choir make the song an instant classic.

The song had been a work-in-progress since 1983. Former GNR co-founder and guitarist Tracii Guns explained:

When we were doing that EP for L.A. Guns, like ‘83? He was playing “November Rain”—and it was called “November Rain”—you know, on piano. Way back then, it was the only thing he knew how to play, but it was his. He’d go, “Someday this song is gonna be really cool.” And I’d go, “It’s cool now.” “But it’s not done”, you know, he used to say. And, like, anytime we’d be at a hotel or anywhere, there’d be a piano; he’d just kinda play that music. And I’d go, “When are you gonna finish that already”, you know? And he’d go, “I don’t know what to do with it.”

The lyrics and video are based on a short story by Del James called “Without You” from a collection called The Language of Fear, which was brought back to market in 2008 after being out of print. The new version of the book contains an intro by Axl Rose, who wrote:

Del James has a personal knowledge of most of the situations he writes about, and has a love of the gutter from having been there.

James has also contributed lyrics to GNR songs The Garden"" and “Yesterdays” and has directed several music videos.

“November Rain” hit #3 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, #9 in Germany where it charted for 51 weeks, #5 in Australia riding the Top 10 for 22 weeks and #7 in New Zealand ending 1992 as their second best-selling single.","September 17, 1991"

It was one of the first compositions written by Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin while in Los Angeles, being present in the band’s demo tape to Geffen in 1986. Axl once described the song as being about “A woman leaving a man.” The girl is someone who Izzy Stradlin once dated, and who Axl was attracted to. Axl really liked this girl, but things couldn’t work out between them, which really hurt him and inspired him to write the song.

The music video started a trilogy, and translates how Axl’s life was going awry:

With our video for “Don’t Cry,” and the fight that Stephanie Seymour, (his then-girlfriend) and I had over the gun, you don’t necessarily know what’s going on. But in real life that happened with Erin Everly (his ex-wife) and myself. I was going to shoot myself. We fought over the gun and I finally let her win.

According to Matt Sorum, “November Rain,” “Don’t Cry” and “Estranged” were conceived as one song, and the three tracks form a trilogy of sorts. Sorum played the same drum fill throughout those three songs and took some criticism for doing so—notably from former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy.

Sorum points out that this was intentional, a way of unifying the songs. “That was my part in tying enough songs together to make it one voice,” he told us.","September 17, 1991"

Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low

Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead

It became an international success, reaching #1 in seven countries and peaking at #9 in the United States. Seventeen years after its initial release, “Bohemian Rhapsody” re-entered the pop charts in the US, peaking at #2 after being featured in the 1992 hit movie Wayne’s World. In 2002, the song was listed at #1 in a Guinness World Records poll as Britain’s favourite single of all time—ranking higher than four Beatles tracks and “Imagine” by John Lennon.

Complex and operatic both musically and lyrically, “Bohemian Rhapsody” (like Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” and The Eagles‘ “Hotel California”) has attracted endless fan theories and commentary. The surviving band members have claimed that the narrative is based on the Faust legend; critics have found possible sources in opera and Freddie Mercury’s personal biography; but like any good piece of art, it’s open to interpretation.

The word “Bohemian” seems to refer to a group of artists and musicians from the 19th century, known for defying convention and living with disregard for standards; as opposed to the region of Bohemia in the Czech Republic. Meanwhile the term “rhapsody” (derived from the Greek: ῥαψῳδός or rhapsōidos for a reciter of epic poetry, or a rhapsodist) is a piece of classical music with distinct sections that are played as one movement. Rhapsodies often feature dense themes or narratives.

As of December 2018, “Bohemian Rhapsody” is the most streamed song of the 20th century.

“Bohemian Rhapsody” has got a very diverse song structure. It includes:
• Intro (0:00-0:49)
• Ballad section (0:49-2:37)
• Brian May‘s’ guitar solo (2:37-3:05)
• Operatic verse (3:05-4:07)
• Hard-rock verse (4:07-4:54)
• Coda (4:54-5:55)","October 31, 1975"

Critically, the song performed well, releasing as a single after the release of album Jazz. Despite reaching number 9 on the UK charts and later going Platinum, it only hit 86 on the US charts.

Peaking at #2 in the UK, the song became a hit in seven other European countries as well. “Killer Queen” was the first Queen single to successfully ‘cross the pond’, becoming a top 20 hit in the U.S. and Canada, as well as a top 30 hit in Australia.

In the New Musical Express of November 2, 1974, the song’s writer and Queen’s frontman Freddie Mercury elucidates on this song: “It’s about a high class call girl. I’m trying to say that classy people can be whores as well. That’s what the song is about, though I’d prefer people to put their interpretation upon it – to read into it what they like.”

While it may seem like a typical popular song, the structure utilised in the song is quite unusual. There are 4 bar phrases immediately followed by 5 bar phrases and then 2 bar phrases, with tempo changing from 12/8 to 6/8 and vice versa.

The main key being Eb major is very unorthodox for Rock music, as guitars don’t usually play flats. Brian May, who pioneered a heavier hard rock sound, had been struck with hepatitis during the majority of the recording. Upon initially hearing the song, Brian was shocked over the more progressive, lighter sound. Nevertheless, the rest of the band left space for Brian to record his own iconic guitar melodies.

The song includes prominent uses of multi-tracking, not just on the vocals, but also in the guitar solo. Other effects used include the flanger (pitch bends), panning (sound moving from the left ear to the right), portamento/glissando (sliding from one note to another), distortion (giving a creamy feel), wah-wah on the guitar, string bending and sliding.

The band had decided not to use the ubiquitous synthesiser, as they thought it was superfluous. Instead, instrumentation utilised includes a jangle piano (detuned), drum kit, bass guitar, electric guitar and vocals.



The song “Killer Queen” may also be recognized by fans of the Japanese manga series “JoJo’s Bizzare Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable” by Hirohiko Araki, in which a character named Yoshikage Kira has a spiritual manifestation called a “Stand” named “Killer Queen”. To avoid copyright issues, most American publications of the series renamed the Stand “Deadly Queen”.","October 11, 1974"

The song’s success and omnipresence in the early ‘90s brought the band unrivaled popularity. Eventually, Kurt grew tired of it and removed it from their live set as often as possible.

Rock history recalls Kathleen Hanna from Bikini Kill scrawling the phrase “Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit” in spray paint on a wall, from which Kurt took the title. Some say Kurt took it as a call for a revolution, in reference to the Bikini Kill-led riot grrl movement; but according to producer Butch Vig, Kurt just thought the phrase “was stupid,” and it didn’t really mean anything at all. However, it was later revealed that Hanna was referring to the brand of deodorant worn by Kurt’s then-girlfriend and Hanna’s then-bandmate Tobi Vail.

In a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone, Cobain said:

I was trying to write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it. When I heard [them] for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I should have been in that band—or at least in a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard.

It was one of the last tracks written and recorded for the album, and the final version is comprised of the second take out of just three takes, according to Montage of Heck and other sources.

“Smells Like Teen Spirit” was voted #9 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.","September 10, 1991"

(“Smells Like Teen Spirit” was imagined as more for committed grunge fans.) However, the surprise success of “Smells Like Teen Spirit”, which came to be considered their signature song, made this plan inconsequential. Despite this overshadowing, the song had good commercial success, peaking at 32 on the Billboard and 9 on the UK singles charts.

The song’s lyrics appear to have a foreshadowing tone given Cobain’s death by self-inflicted gunshot wound. However, in the context of the song they seem to be an ironic comment about people’s bad intentions.

Kurt Cobain spoke about the lyrics on Nevermind: It’s An Interview:

The lines in the song are really contradictory. One after another they are kind of a rebuttal to each line. It’s kind of confusing I guess. It’s just about people and what they are expected to act like.

The song’s distinctive guitar riff was heavily borrowed from Killing Joke’s song “The Eighties,” a fact that made the band hesitate to release the song as a single. Nirvana manager Danny Goldberg told Rolling Stone:

Kurt was nervous about ‘Come as You Are’ because it was too similar to a Killing Joke song “Eighties”, but we all thought it was still the better song to go with. And, he was right, Killing Joke later did complain about it.

Despite their complaints, Killing Joke never filed suit against Nirvana.

The song also includes a rare extended guitar solo for Cobain, whose immersion in stripped-down punk aesthetics meant he didn’t often engage in musical self-indulgence. Producer Butch Vig recalled:

Kurt really did not play a lot of solos. This one is more of a melodic part based on the vocal melody. It’s not trying to show off pyrotechnics. It complements the melody of the song.

In Aberdeen, Washington, which is the birthplace of Cobain, he is commemorated by a sign which says “Come as you are”:","March 2, 1992"

“Heart-Shaped Box” received critical acclaim during radio airplay and reached number 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts.

The music video was directed by Anton Corbijn and it was conceptualized by Kurt. During the song’s first verse, the old man from the hospital climbs onto a crow-ridden Christian cross. The second verse introduces a young girl in a white robe and peaked cap reaching for human fetuses in a tree, and an overweight woman in a suit with human organs painted onto it and with angel wings affixed to her back.

While most of the video was devised by Cobain, Corbijn added elements such as the intentionally artificial crows, a ladder for the old man to climb onto the cross with, and a box with a heart at the top that the band performs inside of during the song’s final chorus.

The title invokes lithium salts, a key drug in treating the disorder.

The CD single contained a sonogram photo of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love’s still to be born child, Frances Bean; Kurt said he thought he saw Frances doing the heavy metal devil horn hand gesture when he watched the sonogram.","July 13, 1992"

Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends

Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already

Chart wise, it peaked at #1 on Billboard’s Alternative Songs and was certified Gold by RIAA.

The song was produced entirely acoustically and features an upright bass, cello, and brushes on the drums. The track is also the only blink-182 track to-date in which Travis uses brushes instead of drumsticks.

Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus wrote the song in a two-part way, combining two songs together to make this track. The song was inspired by The Cure’s song “The Lovecats” and contains a reference to the film The Nightmare Before Christmas.

The track went on to inspire The Chainsmokers‘ “Closer.”","November 18, 2003"

DeLonge wrote this song about his then-girlfriend and eventual wife, Jenna Jenkins. His anecdotes—like the one about her leaving flowers on the stairs, are actually true. In a Rolling Stone profile from the year this song came out, Hoppus said:

Tom is totally, 100 percent faithful to his girlfriend. He’s pretty straightforward: He hangs out with his girlfriend, and he believes in aliens.

It was the last song the pop punk trio recorded for their third album Enema of the State and was one of three singles from the album that launched them into mainstream success. That album would remain their most successful album to date.

DeLonge began this song with a guitar riff and wanted to make a song with a lot of “na na na’s,” a homage to his punk idols, the Ramones. He told Kerrang!:

Because it was so simple, it wasn’t so much fun to play. But once we put it all together, and played it as a band, we all looked at each other and said, ‘This song’s huge!’

The video for this song is a parody of the Backstreet Boys video for “I Want It That Way”. Mark Hoppus met his wife, Skye Everly, an MTV executive, on the set of the video shoot.","June 1, 1999"

I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again? What's my age again?

Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again? What's my age again?

Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
(What's my age again? What's my age again?)
That's about the time that she broke up with me (Please stay with me)
No one should take themselves so seriously (Please stay with me)
With many years ahead to fall in line (Please stay with me)
Why would you wish that on me?

The original title was “Peter Pan Complex,” but their record company (MCA) changed it, believing people wouldn’t understand its meaning.

The song follows a character (most probably Mark Hoppus himself) who is 23 years old but still acts like a child. He pulls up pranks and jokes that annoy people and is left wondering if he is portraying his real age. He finally concludes that he shouldn’t care what people think of him and continues his childish ways.","June 1, 1999"

Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault

“Adam” is used as a metaphor towards Mark’s depression he experienced while on tour with Blink-182. He stated:

Tom and Travis always had girlfriends waiting back home, so they had something to look forward to at the end of the tour. But I didn’t, so it was always like, I was lonely on tour, but then I got home and it didn’t matter because there was nothing there for me anyway.

“Adam’s Song” is also commonly attributed to the urban myth of Adam Krieger, a fictional character whose suicide letter is falsely portrayed as being the original letter that the band received before writing the song. This fake suicide letter, that is often posted online via places like tumblr, is fictitional and was originally written for a play.

The song’s title is also a reference to a skit from the cult classic HBO sketch show, “Mr. Show With Bob and David”, where in the sketch a band called Titanica writes a song called “Try Again (Adam’s Song)” with the intent of encouraging a fan to kill himself so they won’t be able to take him on tour after said fan tried to kill himself after hearing their song “Try Suicide.”","June 1, 1999"

That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you

Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever
And after all this time, I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)

Still into You is the ninth track on the album and the second to be released as a single.

Still Into You peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100, at the time the second-highest a Paramore song had ever reached. Hayley talked about its commercial success when the song was played during her hosting appearance on the Sirius XM Hits 1 Weekend Countdown:

This song, I’m so so happy that this song is getting played on the radio. It’s probably my favorite Paramore song that we’ve ever written, actually. It’s about commitment to that one person that you just fall in love with and you have to just choose and you have to work so hard to stay in love. It’s not an easy task. It’s not a walk in the park, if you will.”

She told DIY that during the writing process, she knew it had the potential to be big.

Still Into You was one that five minutes into writing, it scared me. I loved it so much that it really actually scared me. Like, I feel like this is a big song, but you never know.”

Still, Hayley said during the band’s interview on Good Morning America that the song nearly wasn’t released as a single:

We just didn’t think that a love song would work as a Paramore hit. But we’ve always loved it. It was just like really? That’s going to work?”

The song highlights the band’s shift to more of a pop sound, something they had reservations about doing, especially when it came to the song’s chorus. Hayley said in Still Into You’s Beyond the Video, “When we got to the chorus I remember asking Taylor. I was like, “Is this too poppy? Can I do this? Can I say it like this or can I sing it like this?” And I just remember Taylor being like, “Do you like it?” And I was like, “I love it!” And he was like, then who cares, just do it anyways. I think that’s sort of a testament to how the entire writing and recording process went. If we liked something and we believed in it, we did it. We didn’t back down from it just because it was different.”

Hayley talked to Fuse about Chad’s reaction when she first showed him the song.

He got super shy. He didn’t look at me the whole time that we listened to it. Of course I was super psyched like, ‘Look at this song about you! YEAH!’ I’m psyched because Paramore, we don’t have a lot of love songs. I can probably count on one hand how many happy, positive songs that we’ve ever written. So I’ve just always been super emo at heart. So yeah, I’m just really excited that we have a song like this. Because it feels so good.”","March 14, 2013"

You can run on the fumes of being a teenager for as long as you want, but eventually life hits you real hard.

The playful ‘80s vibe of the song is also contrasted with Hayley’s new look; she dyed her trademark bright hair a dull white as a kind of “blank slate.”



“Hard Times” was released on April 19, 2017 as the lead single from Paramore’s fifth album After Laughter, released on May 12, 2017. It is also their comeback single after a three-year hiatus and the first since drummer Zac Farro’s return.","April 19, 2017"

I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way

Hayley went on to say the song reflects how her angsty 17-year-old self-dealt with a close friend (who she was possibly falling in love with) but was becoming distant – and thus is not necessarily something she identifies after nearly a decade.

On May 31, 2015, Hayley said about the track:

“Misery Business” is not a set of lyrics that I relate to as a 26-year-old woman. I haven’t related to it in a very long time. those words were written when I was 17… admittedly, from a very narrow-minded perspective. It wasn’t really meant to be this big philosophical statement about anything. it was quite literally a page in my diary about a singular moment I experienced as a high schooler.

Hayley announced on September 9, 2018 that Paramore will no longer be performing this track on stage again.

In 2020, reflecting on the early years, Hayley admitted that the song was about Josh:

When I was 13 or 14 and I had a crush on Josh, he didn’t like me back. He would go hang out with his girlfriend, who I wrote “Misery Business” about because I was a dick.","April 13, 2007"

And curse at the wind

I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But darling

You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone
Or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content
With loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Let go of what's in front of me here

Hayley Williams explained to Kerrang! in 2009:

I’ve never written lyrics like this before. The first verse is about where I think the fear to be open or vulnerable started. Ever since the first story in Kerrang!, everyone has known about my family issues and domestic whatever, it’s something that’s kinda stayed with me and I’ve learned from. I played this song to my mom and there were tears. It was kind of embarrassing.

Hayley Williams told Alternative Press in 2010:

This is the first love song I’ve ever written. And even if I’ve tried in the past, this is the first one that I’m really proud of. I like that I was able to express the fact that I have always been really afraid of love – and I still am at times – but the excitement and the hope that it exists is still very evident in the lyrics. So it’s not like I’m a total cynic! Love is a good thing, kids.

In terms of its success as a single, it notably reached 24th on the US Billboard’s Top 100 and 31st on the UK’s Single Chart.","September 29, 2009"

And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?

The song, particularly John Frusciante’s guitar work, sounds different from the rest of the album. That is because the band originally planned to scrap the song because they couldn’t find the music to match Kiedis' lyrics, but Anthony encouraged Frusciante to get creative because he knew they could be dealing with a great song. From his autobiography Scar Tissue:

“I showed ""Californication” to John, and he loved the lyrics and started writing some music. But for some reason, even though there was a perfect song in there, we couldn’t find it. We tried ten different arrangements and ten different choruses, and nothing ever worked. All these other songs were pouring out of us. We’d been working for a few weeks when someone started playing an ultra-sparse riff that sounded like nothing we’d ever done before. As soon as I heard it, I knew it was our new song.""

The music video features the band as characters in a fake video game, exploring California and often seeing the bad things going on behind the scenes.

This song was one of their biggest hits, peaking at #69 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #1 on the Modern and Mainstream Rock charts, and, according to Flea, “Californication is the best record the Chili Peppers have ever made.”

Supporting Kiedis' statements on his autobiography Scar Tissue, an “alternate version” of Californication leaked onto the internet, an early demo from the Californication sessions.","June 8, 1999"

They both had smack habits and used to score – and sometimes shoot up – “under a traffic bridge” in a seedy part of the city.

Originally a poem by Anthony Kiedis, this was written during a time when Anthony felt that his sobriety was distancing him from the rest of the band. He arrived at rehearsal during one of his sober periods and found Flea and John smoking pot. When John first joined the band, he and Anthony were inseparable, but in this period, he knew they weren’t even really friends anymore. He wrote these lyrics as a poem while driving home from rehearsal on LA’s 101 freeway.

This leads to the themes of isolation, and made him feel as if Los Angeles was his only friend he could trust.

This song almost never happened, Kiedis was reluctant to express what he felt and didn’t feel it would fit the band’s style. But Rick Rubin discovered it along with the rest of Kiedis’s poetry and demanded that he make it into a song. It peaked at number 2 on the Billboard charts, and helped send the Chili Peppers into the mainstream.

Red Hot Chili Peppers,Can’t Stop,"Can’t Stop Lyrics
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screamin' in the jungle (Oh, oh-oh)
Complete the motion if you stumble (Oh-oh)
Go ask the dust for any answers (Oh-oh)
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna be a close one (Oh, oh-oh)
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one (Oh-oh)
All on a spaceship, persevering (Oh-oh)
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you (Oh, oh-oh)
Mop tops are happy when they feed you (Oh-oh)
J. Butterfly is in the treetop (Oh-oh)
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
Wait a minute, I'm passin' out, win or lose
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
Right on cue


Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation

Don't die, you know, the truth is some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through89Embed","Released as a the third single from By The Way, “Can’t Stop” is known for its simple but catchy guitar riff, pulsating bass and thoroughly cryptic lyrics.

Throughout the track, Anthony Kiedis highlights the predominant theme of nurturing an inner, personal energy. He addresses the verses to the listener in an instructional tone, whilst referencing inspirational figures such as Julia Butterfly Hill, Charlie Parker, and Defunkt.

A 2002 Interview with Spin Magazine revealed that the song is one that uses the band’s technique of writing lyrics to establish a rhythm, rather than making a rhythm to establish lyrics.

The track was accompanied by a surreal music video inspired by the “One-Minute Sculptures” of Austrian artist Erwin Wurm, in which the four band members perform random abstract actions worthy of display in an art gallery.

With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view

Ah, push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health, 'cause

With the birds (Share this lone—), I'll share this lonely view
With the birds (Share this lone—), I'll share this lonely view
With the birds (Share this lone—), I'll share this lonely view

A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
I wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share
With the birds (Share this lonely), I'll share this lonely view
With the birds (Share this lonely), I'll share this lonely view

Soft-spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet, we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and

(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view

Scar tissue is a good comparison, as it is a sign that there was damage but it healed, and it could also refer to the healed areas where an addict used to inject themself.

This song won them a Grammy in 2000 for Best Rock Song, and peaked at #8 on the Billboard Charts.","May 25, 1999"

That should wither
Piercing through, around the haze
Pillared clouds drift away

Maybe the next

Tangerine Dream,Bent Cold Sidewalk,"Bent Cold Sidewalk LyricsWhen I talk to the trees
O'great trees who have learned to speak slowly
I know that they believe that they have an answer
Then I walk in the city where I cannot hear it
When I talk to the city
I have already learned three answers
Before I call the question
And slowly, I wish myself among trees
But can not hear myself wishing
When I talk to the people
Who are the trees that grow in the city
They reply with a fond kindness, slowly
But there is no answer
For experience to be made by mistake
Upon this key, time will slide
Beyond the lock, you lose your mind
And as our door becomes open
A rush of sound is found inside
Creating dreams that pass you by
You may live through your life a long long time..
But you will never know from where it came
Yet all you've seen is what you've wanted to
You're walking forward as you look behind
Still watching those old memories fade and die...
This door is heavy, and is deeply stained
With wasted tears, that try to fight in vain
You may be sitting, feeling quite secure
But listen carefully - and this key is yours -
For we can lead you far beyond that door...
There are dangers hidden, trust in that language
And it is precisely this conception that which must not be changed
The epitome of our language is patterns containment of thought and sound
I die to fight!!
I die to fight!!
I die to fight!!
Upon this key, time will slide
Beyond each lock, you lose your mind
And as our door becomes open
A rush of sound is found inside -
Creating dreams that pass you by..
Bent cold sidewalk, open the gate
I may be late but I can no longer wait
Stealing the crown that stood me up
I'm laying the table with dusty plates
Bent cold sidewalk, open the gate

Playing the god to fix your gaze
I'm holding you firm on another day

Tangerine Dream,Tyger,"Tyger LyricsTyger, Tyger, burning bright
In the forests of the night
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand dare sieze the fire?
And what shoulder, and what art
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat
What dread hand? and what dread feet?
What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
When the stars threw down their spears
And water'd heaven with their tears
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

In the forests of the night
What immortal hand or eye
Dare frame thy fearful symmetryEmbed","One of the rare Tangerine Dream songs with vocals, this song uses William Blake’s “The Tyger” for the lyrics.

Edgard Froese said this about the usage of William Blake’s poetry:

My interests in philosophy lead me to William Blake, whom I’ve admired for about 20 years as one of the greatest writers in the English language – apart from Shakespeare. I myself had a problem with Jocelyn during the recording. She’d already got through the texts, but during the session she took the book and smashed it on the floor, saying, ‘I’m an R & B singer and I don’t want to do this schoolkid bullshit!’ I still think she did a fairly good job, but she hated the lyrics, which are not easy to understand if you don’t know the background. It helps to know what Britain was all about when Blake wrote the story. It was an empire and his words were partly political, social and esoteric at the same time. If you don’t comprehend this then you may have a problem interpreting it correctly. Even my colleagues didn’t understand, so I don’t blame Jocelyn or anybody else. The recording session was very hard work, but it was my baby and I take full responsibility for that record.","June 10, 1987"

Technology can actually increase privacy. The question is: why are our private details that are transmitted online, why are private details that are stored on our personal devices, any different than the details and private records of our lives that are stored in our private journals? (Stored in our private journals), I think, you know, saying that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say. It's a deeply anti-social principal because rights are not just individual - they're collective. What may not have value to you today, may have value to an entire, you know, population, entire people, an entire way of life tomorrow. And if you don't stand up for it, then who will?

And if you don't stand up for it, then who will?

Up the church steeples and the chimney-pots so high
Watching, the Moon is lost behind black clouds
And the darkness seems to crawl up to the sky

“Love to Hate You” is a 1991 song by English synth-pop duo Erasure. It was released as the second single from their fifth studio album, Chorus. Written by band members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, it is an electronic dance track clearly inspired by disco music. The synthesizer melody in the chorus is an interpolation of the string break from American singer Gloria Gaynor’s disco-era classic I Will Survive. The duo also recorded a Spanish version of the song, called “Amor y Odio” (Love and Hatred), and one in Italian called “Amo Odiarti”. The single was released by Mute Records in the UK and Sire Records in the US. It peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and became a Top 10 hit in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland and Sweden.

Critical reception
AllMusic editor Ned Raggett described the song as “supersassy”. Larry Flick from Billboard called it a “techno-conscious twirler”, that nicks an idea or two from Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive”. He complimented Andy Bell’s “sassy and soulful” performance as an interesting contrast to the track’s “overall electro tone”. The Daily Vault’s Michael R. Smith noted it as “an instant crowd pleaser of sorts”, adding that it “comes complete with live audience effects in the background.” Bill Wyman from Entertainment Weekly stated that the song “has a thumpy bottom and a passable hook.” Chris Gerard from Metro Weekly described it as “old-school disco with echoes of ""I Will Survive” in the verse and hints of ABBA as well. It’s a killer dance tune, but it’s just as good as a pop single. The vocal arrangement is clever, and the crowd noise during the big synth solos add to the excitement.“ Music & Media said it is a ""top rate pop/dance song, which draws influences from ‘70s Giorgio Moroder productions. The synthesizer outfit takes us to a lovely Caribbean bridge that will work as well on EHR as in clubland.” Music Week commented, “The instant familiarity” of “Love to Hate You” “is due in no small part to the fact that it seems to be based on several previous hits, most notably Gloria Gaynor’s I Will Survive, Elton John’s Nobody Wins and even Modern Romance’s Everybody Salsa. Typically throbbing Hi-NRG, subtle it is not, but a hit it most certainly is.” Darren Lee from The Quietus noted “the camp melodrama”, stating that it is one of “the most gloriously effervescent pop anthems ever recorded.” Mark Frith from Smash Hits wrote that “it’s rather nice to welcome Erasure back. With a tune that’s, erm, borrowing bits from certain '70s dance tunes, it’s a tale of life’s annoying Casanovas, and full of beans it is too.” Christopher Smith from TalkAboutPopMusic described it as “more early-80’s style electro pop and yet it felt so fresh in 1991.” He added, “This is one of those Erasure songs that you know word for word and are able to quote without fail at any concert where this is played.”

Chart performance
Love to Hate You is one of Erasure’s most successful singles on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number four. It became a top-ten hit in Greece, where it reached number nine; Finland, where it reached number seven; Austria, where it reached number six; Denmark and Ireland, where it reached number five; and Sweden, where it reached number four. In the US it reached number 17 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, number 10 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart, and number six on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.","September 9, 1991"

Marcus Eoin told XLR8R in 2001:

Someone criticized me once, and asked why we’d made ‘Roygbiv’ so short. For us, that is exactly how long it should be. It’s like that famous bit at the end of ‘Strawberry Fields’ by The Beatles, where you get the little voice at the end that says something like ‘I buried Paul,’ and it happens once, and it’s such a transitory thing that’s mixed in one ear really far away, but people went on and on about it for decades.

Showstopping, indelible and effusive—not to mention successful! It hit 11 in the UK and peaked at 7 in the US almost 2 years after its original release date. It also inspired Disclosure and Smith to collaborate again, with the two of them working together later on “Omen.”

British singer Sam Smith, who provides the vocals on the track, was initially hesitant to jump on the project. In an interview with KISS FM UK, they were quoted as saying:

I remember hearing “Latch” and I didn’t even know whether it was good or not, because I didn’t know electronic music or dance music. It just wasn’t for me.

Fortunately, despite their early inexperience, they took the opportunity and their career was launched.","October 4, 2012"

Disclosure spoke about the collaboration in an interview with Pitchfork:

Well, we performed with her at the BRIT Awards and knew she was a really good singer. And she’s really nice as well, which is cool. When we had nearly finished the record, we got this call from her saying that she was in London and wanted to get in the studio, so we went in not really expecting anything. It was a quick process. That beat is more like a hip-hop beat than anything else, and we all liked it, so we just started writing—we didn’t have a board meeting at the start, like, “We’re gonna do this.”","September 23, 2015"

This is the third collaboration between the artists, with the first being the huge international hit, “Latch”, and the second being “Together”.

This catchy pop tune about a love-story gone wrong was premiered on July 27th, 2015. The release also included a music video which continues on from “Holding On”. It depicts a night of dancing interrupted by police units. The short film ended with the ominous words “to be continued”.

In an interview with Pitchfork, the brothers said the following about this track:

We’re really close with Sam and we share the same managers, so it wasn’t too hard in terms of linking up the date. As a guy, he’s not changed at all—he’s the same Sam that we met four years ago.

The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart

The Weeknd lends his R&B crooning to the track as he sings about insomnia and nighttime blues.

Guy Lawrence explains:

We’ve been fans of each other’s music for some time. We didn’t really know what he was like as a guy, but he turned out to be so safe and cool and chill—but not arrogant in any way. We wrote that song in Jungle Studios in New York, which is probably the coolest studio that we’ve ever been to. It has this panoramic view of Manhattan, so that informed the vibe.

In the EW interview Lawrence said:

The sun was going down and it was such a lovely vibe…and the vibe of driving around late and night, and it’s getting dark, and the beat’s pretty slow. Abel was loving it. We were all feeling that vibe and just let it flow. And it’s f—ing long, isn’t it? It’s like nothing we’ve made before.","September 25, 2015"

Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue

I knew, you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new

Worry, why do I let myself worry?
Wondering, what in the world did I do?

Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you
Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you4Embed","“Crazy” was written by Willie Nelson in 1961, early in his career. According to Nelson, the song was originally called, “Stupid.”

It was recorded by Patsy Cline and went to number two on the Billboard Country chart in 1962.  She initially hated the song, but her husband, Charlie Dick, convinced her to record it.

Crazy became her biggest hit, and it’s in the list of the 500 Greatest Country Songs.

I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away


I've always loved you and made you happy
And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams

Johnny Cash,Hurt,"Hurt Lyrics

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way142Embed","This song, originally written and performed by Nine Inch Nails, is of disputed meaning: is it about self harm, doing heroin, or both? Either way, no matter if it reflects Cash’s addiction issues, or suicidal thoughts, it’s one of Cash’s classics. Johnny decided to change just one line, possibly reflecting his Christian faith.

The song was recommended to Cash by legendary producer, Rick Rubin, who produced Johnny Cash’s American series (and released them on his label American Recordings).  When Trent Reznor was asked if the song could be covered he said he was:

flattered [but worried that] the idea sounded a bit gimmicky.

However, after watching the video:

Wow. Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps… Wow. [I felt like] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn’t mine anymore… It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [Somehow] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning — different, but every bit as pure.

The song was released as a single in March 2003, along with “Personal Jesus,” a Depeche Mode cover. It was the last single released by Cash before his death in September 2003. Cash saw it hit #33 on the Billboard “Alternative Songs” chart, and #56 on its Hot Country Charts, 48 years after his Cry! Cry! Cry! first hit the US Country chart.

 The music video becomes even more harrowing when one realises that June Carter Cash, Johnny’s wife, died only three months after it was made, and that the house it was filmed in (the Cash residence for 30 years) later burned down.","November 5, 2002"

Cash would continue to walk the line with his first wife, Vivian Liberto, until 1966.  June Carter finally became June Carter Cash in 1968.

After being originally recorded by June’s sister Anita Carter as “(Love’s) Ring of Fire”, the song was recorded by Cash on March 25, 1963.  It became the biggest hit of his career, staying at number one on the charts for seven weeks. It was certified Gold on January 21, 2010 by the R.I.A.A. and has also sold over 1.2 million digital downloads.



In 2002, shortly before his death, Cash sang another cover, “Hurt”; the perfect bookend to “Ring of Fire”. In it Cash acknowledges his failures as a husband and friend. If “Ring of Fire” was the first warning sign of an obsessive-compulsive personality, “Hurt” is the final apology.","March 25, 1963"

I keep my eyes wide open all the time

Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line22Embed","One of his most famous songs, “I Walk the Line” is Johnny Cash’s promise to remain faithful to his first wife, Vivian, while he is on the road.  It seems a certain ring of fire interfered with this pledge.

The song became Cash’s first #1 Billboard hit. The single remained on the record charts for over 43 weeks, and sold over 2 million copies.



The title of the song was also used to name the Johnny Cash biopic film starring Joaquin Phoenix, and a Gregory Peck film.

This song’s influence on the music world is palpable. In his autobiography, Bob Dylan makes strong mention of its effect on him:

“I Walk the Line” [is] a song I’d always considered to be up there at the top, one of the most mysterious and revolutionary of all time, a song that makes an attack on your most vulnerable spots, sharp words from a master.
“I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.” Indeed. I must have recited those lines to myself a million times… When I first heard “I Walk the Line” so many years earlier, it sounded like a voice calling out, “What are you doing there, boy?” I was trying to keep my eyes wide opened, too.",April 1956

“Jolene” has been covered numerous times by major country, rock and pop artists. Most notable is The White Stripes‘ 2004 live cover, which reached the top 20 in the UK.

The song is about an tale of a woman confronting Jolene, a stunningly beautiful woman, who she believes is trying to steal away her lover and begging her “please don’t take my man.” Throughout the song, the woman implores Jolene “please don’t take him just because you can.” According to Parton, the song was inspired by a red-headed bank clerk who flirted with her husband Carl Dean at his local bank branch around the time they were newly married. In an interview, she also revealed that Jolene’s name and appearance are based on that of a young fan who came on stage for her autograph.",October 1973
Dolly Parton,9 to 5,"9 to 5 Lyrics
Tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it

You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...

They let you dream just to watch them shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day your ship will come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way
Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life putting money in his wallet

This song not only reached number one on the country charts, but also, in February 1981, reached number one on the pop and the adult-contemporary charts, giving her a triple-number-one hit. Parton became one of the few female country singers to have a number-one single on the country and pop charts simultaneously.

It also was a top 10 hit in Austria, Sweden, Belgium and New Zealand, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song, won two Grammys, and remains a workers' anthem. The basic rhythm pattern for the song was inspired by the sound that Parton’s fingernails make when rubbed together. In fact, they were recorded and featured in the song.

Sidenote: The Disney version of the performance gave some a very deluded and fanciful notion of the workplace, who only wish Minnie and Daisy had pink desks next to theirs. There are not nearly enough adorable musical numbers in my office!","November 10, 1980"
Dolly Parton,Coat of Many Colors,"Coat of Many Colors Lyrics
Back through the years I go wandering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mama put the rags to use

There were rags of many colors, every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mama sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of

As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colors that my mama made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me

So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me
But they didn't understand it for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch
And I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes

But they didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
That one is only poor only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me
Made just for me3Embed","Dolly has described this song on numerous occasions as her favorite of the songs she has written. She composed the song in 1969, while traveling with Porter Wagoner on a tour bus.","October 30, 1971"

Recorded on June 13, 1973, Parton wrote the song for her one-time partner and mentor Porter Wagoner, from whom she was professionally splitting at the time.

With “I Will Always Love You,” Parton became the first artist ever to earn a number one record twice with the same song as a singer, and three times as a writer. “I Will Always Love You” is the second song ever to reach the top three on the Billboard Hot 100 in separate chart runs. Parton also sang the song in the film The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.

Whitney Houston recorded a version of the song for the 1992 film The Bodyguard and it stayed on top of the Billboard Hot 100 for a then-record of 14 weeks. It became one of the best selling singles of all time, and it is widely misconstrued that Whitney Houston wrote the song.

Willie Nelson,I’m My Own Grandpa,"I’m My Own Grandpa Lyrics
Now, many many years ago
When I was twenty three
I was married to a widow
Who was pretty as could be
This widow had a grown-up daughter
Had hair of red
My father fell in love with her
And soon the two were wed
This made my dad my son-in-law
And changed my very life
My daughter was my mother
Because she was my father's wife
To complicate the matters
Even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father
Of a bouncing baby boy
My little baby then became
A brother-in-law to dad
And so became my uncle
Though it made me very sad
For if he was my uncle
That also made him the brother
Of the widow's grown-up daughter
Who, of course, was my step-mother
I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

My father's wife then had a son
That kept them on the run
And he became my grandchild
For he was my daughter's son
My wife is now my mother's mother
And it makes me blue
Because, she is my wife
She's my grandmother too

I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

Then, I am her grandchild

The clothes I'm wearing from now on won't take up so much yardage
Miniskirts, hot pants, and a few little fancy frills
Yeah, I'm making up for all those years since I've got the pill
I'm tired of all your crowing how you and your hens play
While holding a couple in my arms, another is on the way
This chicken's done tore up her nest and I'm ready to make a deal
And you can't afford to turn it down 'cause you know I've got the pill
This incubator is over-used because you've kept it filled
But feeling good comes easy now since I've got the pill
It's getting dark, it's roosting time, tonight's too good to be real
Aw, but Daddy don't you worry none 'cause Mama's got the pill
Oh, Daddy don't you worry none 'cause Mama's got the pillEmbed","The Pill is Loretta Lynn’s ode to the freedoms and choices that the birth control pill (which was introduced in 1960) gave to women.



The song tells the story of a woman who has spent much of her married life pregnant – and she’s understandably a little bitter about it. However, now she’s got the pill, which gives her the ability to have as much sex as she’d like without risking yet another baby.

Though not strictly autobiographical, the song hints at Loretta’s life – she was the mother of six children, two of whom were born before she turned 19. Soon after the song came out, Lynn told People magazine:

If I’d had the pill back when I was havin’ babies I’d have taken ’em like popcorn. The pill is good for people. I wouldn’t trade my kids for anyone’s. But I wouldn’t necessarily have had six and I sure would have spaced ’em better.”

Though The Pill was timely, it was also controversial, especially for country music. Many radio stations banned the popular song, keeping it from reaching the top of the charts.","January 27, 1975"
Loretta Lynn,You Ain’t Woman Enough (To Take My Man),"You Ain’t Woman Enough (To Take My Man) Lyrics
You've come to tell me something you say I ought to know
That he don't love me anymore and I'll have to let him go
You say you're gonna take him, oh but I don't think you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

Women like you, they're a dime a dozen
You can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him, I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here

It'll be over my dead body, so get out while you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

Sometimes a man's caught lookin' at things that he don't need
He took a second look at you, but he's in love with me
Well I don't know where that leaves you, but I know where I stand
And you ain't woman enough to take my man

Women like you, they're a dime a dozen
You can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him, I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here
It'll be over my dead body, so get out while you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man
No, you ain't woman enough to take my manEmbed",?,May 1966

Loretta Lynn,Coal Miner’s Daughter,"Coal Miner’s Daughter LyricsWell, I was born the coal miner's daughter
In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor, but we had love
That's the one thing that Daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar
My Daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field hoeing corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal-oil light
And everything would start all over come break of morn
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard every day
Why, I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain, there was no need
She's smiled in Mommy's understanding way
In the summertime, we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime, we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail-order catalog
Money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere
Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night, we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler
Well, a lot of things have changed since wayback then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left, but the floor
Nothing lives here anymore
Except the memories of a coal miner's daughter2Embed",?,"October 5, 1970"
Kenny Rogers,The Gambler,"The Gambler Lyrics
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So, if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right""

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep
And when he finished speakin'
He turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em)
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em

Kenny Rogers,Coward of the County,"Coward of the County Lyrics
Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun""

Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them
Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace, took down his daddy's picture
As a tear fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again
Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
When he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor
Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look, old yella's leavin'""
But you could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door
Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothing back, he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, ""This one's for Becky"" as he watched the last one fall
N' I heard him say

I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And Papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man
Everyone considered him the coward of the county3Embed","“Coward of the County” is a country song written by Roger Bowling and Billy Ed Wheeler, and recorded by American country music singer Kenny Rogers. It was released as the second single from the Triple Platinum album Kenny in late 1979.

Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor
And I love you
You have made me what I am and I am yours
My love, there's so many ways
I want to say I love you
Let me hold you in my arms forever more

You have gone and made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh, we belong together
Won't you believe in my song

Lady, for so many years
I thought I'd never find you
You have come into my life
And made me whole
Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear

In my eyes I see no one else but you
There's no other love like our love
And yes, oh yes
I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long
Lady, your love's the only love I need
And beside me is where I want you to be
'Cause my love
There's something I want you to know
You're the love of my life
You're my lady3Embed","“Lady” is a song from Kenny Rogers' 1980 Greatest Hits compilation album. It was written & produced by Lionel Richie.

In fact, the song was so successful that Richie has said, “I have an estate that ‘Lady’ bought”. Originally he wanted the song for himself, but his lawyer set him straight, telling him, “If you give it to Kenny, it will be bigger than you ever thought”. He was right!","September 29, 1980"
Kenny Rogers,Lucille,"Lucille Lyrics
In a bar in Toledo
Across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her
She said I'm no quitter
But I finally quit living on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter
And here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings
In the mirror I saw him
And I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman
Who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused
He looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking
His big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

After he left us
I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room
To a rented hotel room
We walked without talkin' at all
She was a beauty
But when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her
'Cuz the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal

In the 1944 film Gaslight, a man makes his wife think she’s going crazy in part by dimming the gaslight in their home. Since then, the term “gaslighting” has been used to describe emotional manipulation designed to make someone doubt their own memory or perception. It’s likely that “gaslighter” in this context refers to Natalie Maines‘ ex-husband, Adrian Pasdar, with whom she had a public falling out.","March 4, 2020"
The Chicks,Travelin’ Soldier,"Travelin’ Soldier Lyrics
Two days past eighteen
He was waitin' for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair

He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said, ""Would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talkin' to me? I'm feelin' a little low""
She said ""I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go""

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said ""I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?""

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
""Too young for him,"" they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Nevermore to be alone
When the letter said, ""A soldier's comin' home""
So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of

He said, ""When it's gettin' kinda rough over here
I think of that day sittin' down on the pier
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while""

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
""Too young for him,"" they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Nevermore to be alone
When the letter said, ""A soldier's comin' home""

One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said, ""Folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead?""
Cryin' all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marchin' band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
""Too young for him,"" they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Nevermore to be alone
When the letter said, ""A soldier's comin'...""

In the fall of 1990 Bruce Robison was working as a fry cook at an Austin diner and writing his first songs. That August, Iraq had invaded Kuwait, and the United States was preparing for a massive counterinvasion. Robison learned that one of his buddies at the diner, another fry cook, was being called up to active duty…and Robison found himself contemplating the unthinkable: dying young in war. Then he started writing about something even more unbearable: dying young while being in love. The first thing to come to him was a melody—the soaring opening of the chorus—and Robison shoehorned in some words: “I-I-I-I cried, never gonna hold the hand of another guy.” Details quickly followed: a lonely boy leaving for war after high school (Robison changed the setting to Vietnam), a shy girl (“a piccolo player in the marching band”) falling for him, the love between them growing even as they are thousands of miles apart. For the final verse, as the girl cries alone because her soldier has died, Robison recalled a familiar spot, the space beneath the stadium bleachers at Bandera High, where he had gone to school.

In 2003, with the United States again on the verge of war with Iraq, the Dixie Chicks took the song to number one on Billboard’s Hot Country Singles and Tracks chart.","July 26, 2002"

Dissecting issues like school shootings, climate change, gun control, reproductive justice, and racial justice, and The Chicks promise to use their platform as prominent singers and advance the cause for justice.

The official music video affirms the group’s stance on social issues in the US. It contains imagery from civil rights and pride marches, and nods to Black Lives Matter and #SayHerName, a movement dedicated to recognizing the anti-Black and police brutality violence that Black women face. It also confirms the group’s stance on political activism. They spoke out and received backlash in 2003. They’ll continue to do so now, and with a louder voice.

March March is entirely, overtly and unapologetically political: and it reminds us that it’s essential to get involved politically. The Chicks don’t care if their opinions lose them friends – they march  to their own drum.","June 25, 2020"

There's nothin' left for me to figure out

And I'll keep payin'

To do what it is you think I should

I know you've said
""Can't you just get over it?""
It turned my whole world around
And I kinda like it
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter, sayin' that I better
Shut up and sing or my life will be over

7Embed","Controversy erupted over the Dixie Chicks in 2003 following a critical comment vocalist Natalie Maines made of the American President George W. Bush while performing in a concert in London, United Kingdom. In relation to the forthcoming invasion of Iraq, Maines said, “…we don’t want this war, this violence, and we’re ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas.”

Taking the Long Way was the first studio album released by the Dixie Chicks after that. The controversy, and the band’s reaction to it, is the major theme of some of the songs in the album, including “Not Ready to Make Nice”. The song, which was written by all three band members along with Dan Wilson, is a statement of how they feel over the controversy, the banning of their songs from country music radio stations, and freedom of speech.

The song was The Chick’s first and only song to become Double Platinum. Although it hit No. 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100, it only reached No. 36 on the country charts, highlighting a disparity between Country and Pop music and their reaction to the 2003 controversy.

In an interview about the new album, Maines explained,

This album was therapy. To write these songs allowed me to find peace with everything and move on.”","March 24, 2006"

When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feelin' comes to my door
And the whole world turns
Blue

There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two, way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of losin' you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light of a neon moon

Now if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers, runnin' wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room
No tellin' how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Tellin' my poor heart
She'll come back someday

Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light from a neon moon

Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon

The jukebox plays on, drink by drink
And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think
And this hurt inside of me
Ain't never gonna end

Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light from a neon moon
Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

Come watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon
Oh, watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon8Embed","The third of four #1 country singles released from Brooks & Dunn’s massively successful 1991 debut album, Brand New Man. “Neon Moon” refers to the neon bar signs under which the singer spends his evenings sorrowfully remembering a long-lost lover.","February 24, 1992"
Brooks & Dunn,You’re Gonna Miss Me When I’m Gone,"You’re Gonna Miss Me When I’m Gone Lyrics
I'm still hurtin' from the last time
You walked on this heart of mine
I can't find much to believe in
You let me down so many times

Heaven knows how much I love you
But I'm tired of holdin' on

You'd better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

There's not much chance we're gonna make it
If I'm the only one who's tryin'
You know I'm runnin' out of reasons
We're runnin' out of time

Someday, girl, you're gonna wake up
And wonder what went wrong

You'd better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're good at goin' through the motions
And all I hear are alibis
Now I get this empty feelin'
When I look into your eyes

And I don't see a love light shinin'
And I don't know what's goin' on

You'd better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

You'd better kiss me
'Cause you gonna miss me when I'm gone

'Cause you gonna miss me when I'm gone7Embed","Written by Kix Brooks, Ronnie Dunn, and Don Cook, “You’re Gonna Miss Me When I’m Gone” was released in June 1995 as the fourth single from Brooks & Dunn’s third album Waitin' on Sundown. The song reached #1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.

The song notably features Kix Brooks on lead vocals instead of Ronnie Dunn.  It’s Kix’s only lead vocals single to reach #1 on the charts.

The song tells the story of a man who has been mistreated by the woman he is in love with. He admits that he still loves her, will always love her, but has to make the difficult decision to walk away because he knows he cannot trust her with his feelings. The conceit of his leaving her, and also the song’s title, is a reminder that she is the one who’s going to miss him.

Billboard’s Eric Boehler said of the song:

another welcome Brooks & Dunn outing.

… and the magazine’s Deborah Evans Price called it an “excellent song craftsmanship with great production.”","June 12, 1995"
Brooks & Dunn,Red Dirt Road,"Red Dirt Road Lyrics
I was raised off of Rural Route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to the Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned, I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

Her daddy didn't like me much
With my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight
Feels like I've found a long lost friend

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road
Yes, I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road10Embed","Written by Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn, “Red Dirt Road” is the title track single off the duo’s 2003 album. The song reached #1 on the Country charts and #25 on the Billboard top 100.



Ronnie Dunn sings lead vocals on this track, recounting the nostalgic memories he’s associated with the red dirt road of his youth in Alabama, where iron deposits in the ground give the soil a ruddy hue.

The narrative arc tells of a rural boy who grows up, leaves town, loses his way in vices like booze and fast cars, then finds himself again in the love of his boyhood sweetheart and his lord, Jesus.

Brooks and Dunn performed the song at NASCAR legend and B&D collaborator Dale Earnhardt’s tribute concert at the Daytona International Speedway in the summer of 2003.

Out in the country past the city limits sign
Well there's a honky tonk near the county line
The joint starts jumpin' every night when the sun goes down
They got whiskey, women, music, and smoke
It's where all the cowboy folk go to boot scootin' boogie

I've got a good job, I work hard for my money
When it's quittin' time I hit the door runnin'
I fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run
I go flyin' down that highway to that hide-a-way
Stuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin' boogie

Yeah, heel, toe, do-si-do come on baby let's go boot scootin'
Oh Cadillac blackjack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie

I want a shot of that redhead yonder lookin' at me
The dance floor's hoppin' and it's hotter than the fourth of July
I see outlaws, inlaws, crooks & straights all out makin' it shake
Doin' the boot scootin' boogie

Carrie Underwood,Before He Cheats,"Before He Cheats Lyrics
Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know
Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats

Carrie Underwood,Cry Pretty,"Cry Pretty Lyrics
I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keepin' it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is

You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

Oh no, you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river

You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty
You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty

Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah

You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face

In “Cry Pretty”, she exposes her vulnerability and insecurities and gives power to them, empowering and enabling others to feel comfortable doing the same. She tells listeners to join her in embracing their emotions even when they aren’t “pretty”. It is common for people in this society both men and women, to suppress their emotions because they feel they will be viewed as weak or ugly if seen crying or under turmoil. She sends a message to those fans about how unrealistic it is for them to expect to be able to maintain an attractive appearance when going through distress and to embrace how they look. This song promotes healthy expectations, body love, anti-shame and general acceptance.","April 11, 2018"

Thinkin', ""no way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down, I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

If he would have played it just one more time

John Coltrane,Acknowledgement,"Acknowledgement Lyrics

A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme
A love supreme1Embed","“Acknowledgement,” as the beginning phase of the A Love Supreme suite, instrumentally deals with a person’s first introduction to the theme of love: recognizing the presence of one’s future lover. Additionally, Coltrane’s slow repetition of the album title, towards the end of the track, adds on to the idea of being verbally recognized. Thus, this is one of Coltrane’s only tracks in his entire discography to contain spoken words, let alone in the entire A Love Supreme album.

The track opens with a gong and a short cymbal solo accompanied by Coltrane’s light-hearted saxophone, best capturing the idea of “love at first sight.” It then shifts into a more calm sound as the bass slowly and ominously repeats itself if perhaps imitating the phrase, “a love supreme,” similar to Coltrane’s vocal passage at the track’s closure. The bass is then joined in by the saxophone, piano, and percussion as a recreation of the mysterious but relaxing mood of experiencing deep affection from a significant other.

“Acknowledgement” is among one of Coltrane’s more popular jazz pieces and offers a portal into the saxophonist’s illustrious, magnificent magnum opus that revolves around a quite unique theme.","January 1, 1965"

The fact that we do exist is acknowledgement of Thee O Lord.
Thank you God.
God will wash away all our tears …
He always has …
He always will.
Seek Him everyday. In all ways seek God everyday.
Let us sing all songs to God
To whom all praise is due … praise God.
No road is an easy one, but they all
go back to God.
With all we share God.
It is all with God.
It is all with Thee.
Obey the Lord.
Blessed is He.
We are from one thing … the will of God … thank you God.
I have seen God – I have seen ungodly –
none can be greater – none can compare to God.
Thank you God.
He will remake us … He always has and He always will.
It is true – blessed be His name – thank you God.
God breathes through us so completely …
so gently we hardly feel it … yet,
it is our everything.
Thank you God.

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder

It features vocals from singer-songwriter Halsey and Chainsmokers member Andrew Taggart, marking the first time the Chainsmokers feature their vocals on a track—Taggart previously performed backing vocals for the chorus of “Roses”. It is also their first collaboration with Halsey.

At the 2016 MTV VMAs, both the duo and Halsey performed “Closer”. The duo teased the performance as “new level” on Twitter. This was the second time that “Closer” was performed at Madison Square Garden — the first being at Halsey’s sold-out Badlands Tour show on August 13th, 2016 where The Chainsmokers performed as guests.

In September 2016, after “Closer” had already reached the summit of the Billboard Hot 100, Isaac Slade and Joe King, respectively the lead singer and guitarist of The Fray, were given additional songwriting credits on the song due to the similarity of its chorus to the verses of their 2005 breakout hit, “Over My Head (Cable Car).”

On the March-25-dated chart, “Closer” tied LeAnn Rimes Cibrian’s 32 week record in the Billboard Hot 100 top 10. The singer held it for 20 years – beginning December 13, 1997 – with her single “How Do I Live.” She congratulated the hitmaker duo on Twitter by singing a mashup of “Closer” and her own song.

On September 15, 2018, the song was certified Diamond by the RCAA, verifying that the song had sold an equivalent ten million units in the United States alone.

The Chainsmokers,Paris,"Paris Lyrics
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town on our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever

The Chainsmokers tweeted this prior to the release of the track:



The song features uncredited vocals from accomplished New York City singer-songwriter Emily Warren, and is the first original song of 2017 by The Chainsmokers, following a breakout year in 2016.

Warren’s involvement on the track was confirmed by The Chainsmokers' manager Adam Alpert to Billboard. The Chainsmokers hinted at Warren’s involvement in a tweet, and Warren also posted a video on Instagram saying it’s her vocals in the description. A followup interview with Billboard confirmed Warren as the mysterious female vocalist.

The song was first previewed in late December 2016 live appearances at SnowGlobe and the LACC. The Chainsmokers officially teased and verified the song through Facebook in early January 2017. The song was released on January 13, 2017.

The song made its official TV debut on SNL on April 8th 2017. The duo also performed their song, “Break Up Every Night” on the show.","January 13, 2017"

Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, ""Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window""
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go
We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever

The relationship in question is on the brink of falling apart, but a connection still exists through some sort of love and/or weed, and the lovers don’t know whether to keep the relationship going or not.

The song features vocals from LA-based singer-songwriter Phoebe Ryan, and is the fourth original song released in 2016 by The Chainsmokers, following the success of their #1 hit, “Closer.”

After previewing the song at various live appearances in late August, The Chainsmokers confirmed the song would be their next single in early September 2016. Phoebe Ryan teased it on her Twitter four days before and the YouTube audio was released one day before the song’s official release on September 30th.","September 30, 2016"

Take it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and took him higher
Well, I'll be your daydream, I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room

This song represents an inherent change in the right direction not the beginning, but the end of that transition – almost like we have finally come full circle to a place musically we are finally completely happy with a song … That is not just a reflection us personally but also a reflection of us currently. That isn’t to say we won’t continue to evolve and take chances and the music will all sound the same, but this to us felt as natural as drinking the bottle of Patron every show. Roses is us, through and through.

It peaked at #6 on the Hot 100, becoming their highest charting hit until their #3 hit “Don’t Let Me Down.” It outpaced “#SELFIE”, which peaked out at #16.

This is Andrew Taggart’s first time providing vocals to one of The Chainsmokers' songs. He provides backing vocals to the chorus.","June 16, 2015"
The Grateful Dead,Terrapin Station,"Terrapin Station LyricsLady with a Fan
Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
Till my tale is told and done
While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
Till things we've never seen
Will seem familiar
Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago
Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there
Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion's den
""Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance""
The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
And not disaster
The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
And not to master
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold
Terrapin Station
Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin
Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
(Oh)
From the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - if it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - but the train's put its brakes on
And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin
At a Siding
While you were gone
These faces filled with darkness
The obvious was hidden
With nothing to believe in
The compass always points to Terrapin
Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again
For good or ill again2Embed","“Terrapin Part 1” is a track broken up into seven sections: Lady with a Fan, Terrapin Station, Terrapin, At a Siding, Terrapin Flyer, and Refrain. “Terrapin Station” was released as the B-side to the album’s second single, “Passenger.”

“Terrapin” is one of the Dead’s greatest products of simultaneous inspiration. It is a modest symphony that builds into a stunningly powerful love story involving a competition between a cautious soldier and a reckless sailor for the attention of the lady with the fan.



Terrapin is perhaps a poetic tribute to Gary Snyder’s Turtle Island. In that regard, the song serves as a tribute to the hard and bloody journey to a promised land of romantic dreams.

The song was performed around 300 times from 1977 to the end of their career, with the most complete performance from Winterland Arena in early 1977, which included Terrapin Transit. This specific performance is from March 18th, 1977 and can be listened to here. Terrapin Transit is incorrectly labeled as “Alhambra.”","July 27, 1977"
The Grateful Dead,Ripple,"Ripple Lyrics
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice come through the music?
Would you hold it near as it were your own?

It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air

Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty
If your cup is full, may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men

There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go, no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home21Embed","“Ripple” is the sixth song on the Grateful Dead album American Beauty. It was released as the B-side to the single “Truckin'”.

Robert Hunter wrote this song in 1970 in London in the same afternoon he wrote “Brokedown Palace” and “To Lay Me Down” (reputedly also drinking half a bottle of retsina in the process).

The song debuted August 18, 1970 at Fillmore West in San Francisco. Jerry Garcia wrote the music to this song.","November 1, 1970"
The Grateful Dead,Scarlet Begonias,"Scarlet Begonias LyricsAs I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try
She had rings on her fingers and
Bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was
Into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls
In the thick of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and
Was closing the door
I had one of those flashes:
I'd been there before
Been there before
I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right
Well, there ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a
Touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band5Embed","“Scarlet Begonias” is the stand-out masterpiece of 1974’s From the Mars Hotel. The song has a Caribbean feel that Garcia would later relate to Paul Simon’s “Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard.” An acoustic song done electronically, Hunter wrote the lyrics – which echo the British nursery rhyme “Ride a Cock Horse to Banbury Cross” – while living in England. Whether his references are meant to allude to Queen Elizabeth or Lady Godiva, the lady with the flowers was one of Hunter’s most exquisitely romantic objects of desire, a quest destined to fail.



The live debut of “Scarlet Begonias” came on March 23, 1974 at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California. This concert was later released partially on Dick’s Picks Vol. 24","June 27, 1974"
The Grateful Dead,Friend of the Devil,"Friend of the Devil Lyrics
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
Spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, and the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight5Embed","In this song, The Grateful Dead write about a life of crime and how it has affected the narrator—all contained in that beautiful downward melody with which the whole opens and rolls along.

The main theme of the song is that a life of crime always sticks with you. That is to say, once you deal with the devil you will always deal with the devil. The song goes on to talk about all the measures the narrator must take and all the things that he (I assume it is a he) must endure/misses due to his life of crime.

The song was originally written by Robert Hunter for the New Riders of the Purple Sage, and was written along with NRPS’s John Dawson.","November 1, 1970"

Maybe he is coming though while I was away
Too much goodness is a sin today
I'm checking out the show
With a glassy eye
Looking at the sun dancing through the sky
Did he come by U.F.O?
There is something happening
It isn't too clear
Just a little different than the previous year
I think that happiness is getting very near
I'm checking out the show
With a glassy eye
Looking at the sun dancing through the sky
Did he come by U.F.O?
Did he come by U.F.O?
Did he come by U.F.O?2Embed","The title track of Jim Sullivan’s mysterious album, U.F.O. ponders if the second coming of Jesus Christ will be via U.F.O.

The singer eagerly looks up into the sky through a telescope/binoculars to catch a glimpse at a U.F.O. carrying Jesus.

This song may be inspired by the Miracle of the Sun, an event in 1917 where hundreds of eye witnesses in Portugal reported seeing the sun dancing and zig-zagging through the sky. The “miracle” was attributed to the Virgin Mary.

Jim Sullivan,Jerome,"Jerome LyricsAnd I found a magic man
I bought a pound of magic and
A kinda dream and plan
Where you lay you hand
I found a magic man
Where is where it's at Jerome?
Where is there I want to go?
Where is where it's at Jerome?
Is it a place out there?
Just a town down there
If you're driving slow
Where is where it's at Jerome?
If you take your magic slow
Maybe you can find Jerome
Sits on top of a hill
Overneath a hole
If you're driving slow
Maybe you can find Jerome
Maybe you can find Jerome
Maybe you can find Jerome
Look all around and see if you can spot JeromeEmbed","According to Jim, Jerome was a small town that was the birthplace of his Sister-In-Law.

However, the rest of the song could be interpreted to be about psychedelic drugs, or a mystical experience. This makes sense considering the sort of drug-addled grammar of the track, and Jim’s own drug use.",1969

Apart from you as company
Everything I have is borrowed

About those voices in the crowd
Words that started with a whisper
It seems they've gotten all too loud
Yes it finally got to me and so
It's doubtful that I'll ever be
Someone that you love
Plain as your eyes can see
Read what the sides say
Fallen rocks are on the road
The bridge is out you'd better drive slow

Did you know?
I wouldn't let you down
Honey now your sandman's back in town
I'm here honey
Close your eyes
Reach your arms out to me
I have made it

MF DOOM,Doomsday,"Doomsday Lyrics
Mic Check
When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
Come through, dig the sound
I swear the whole world could feel you MC
Crowd around
I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails tight and bob a lot
Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown 6-0 sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um... what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take ""Mens to the End"" for two milli'
""Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!"" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone—turn H2O to Cognac
On Doomsday, ever since the womb
‘Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say
Right above my government; Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?

I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section
If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number seventeen, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on Cee Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape
Definition ""super-villain"": a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get mentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown
On Doomsday!, ever since the womb
‘Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say
Right above my government; Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?

Doomsday, ever since the womb
‘Til I'm back to the essence, read it off the tomb
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?
Pass the mic like ""Pass the peas like they used to say""
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nipplin' tip of nipples metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can, me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the Devil? He's on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF - the Super-Villain!
Doomsday
To dig the sound
Crowd around
When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
I swear the whole world could feel you MC155Embed","Samples “Kiss of Life” by Sade and “Poetry” by Boogie Down Productions.

DOOM explains in XXL Magazine:

[This song was] a while ago, so I’m trying to remember what inspired it. It’s really just normally what I’d be talking about. I kinda do bragging rap. I do the kind of hip-hop where the MC is more pointing out things and accentuating certain things that have been forgotten at some stage. So I’m really just explaining hip-hop rules. Rules about rhyming. Typical shit that you would normally do or don’t do. That’s basically it. Hold on a second, I’m crossing the street right now.

The beat was later released in his Special Herbs beat tapes. The beat is titled “Saffron” and it is on Special Herbs Vol. 2

MF DOOM,Beef Rap,"Beef Rap Lyrics

Now I haven't eaten all day. How am I gonna do this man?
Yeah don't wait for her man, don't wait for her
I'll tell you what man: come with me now and you know
I'll get you some lunch, I'll hook you up with something
I got a little bank, y'know, no problem
I hear you, that's cool (Alright? It's cool)
Man, can't you guys just wait here about a half hour, man?
Yo I'll be back man, I'm just gonna munch up a little bit man, I'm pretty hungry
Yo let him come back

Here you will find food for your body
As well as comfort for your troubled mind
I'd really like some soup (Bread and butter)
Of course my friend. What happened to your hand?
Oh, food at last!

How did they get here?
Regular storage procedure, the same as the other food
What other food?
Fish (Food) protein (Fast for ya)
Now what happened?
Well, the cop got
The next morning I went to the store to get some food
(Bread and butter) They arrested me
I'll save you (Thank you)
Would you like a snack?
Thanks for the drink

Operation Doomsday complete
All your intercoms casualty and damage testing

Enough! You talk of the people's rights
The people have only those rights which I choose to give them
And that's for their own good, believe me
I do, DOOM
They disappoint me, they must work faster
But the prisoner-
Ah yes, the young traitor who has tried to turn my people against me
Watch him. I have special plans for that one

Beef rap, could lead to getting teeth capped
Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap
I suggest you change your diet
It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease
It ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze
Take the easy way out phony, until then
They know they wouldn't be talking that bologna in the bullpen
So disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this
They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen injustice
Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet
Two batteries, some Brillo and some foil, heat'll boil it
He be better off on PC glued
And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood
Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed
(Food, we need food!)
He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh
A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous
Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit
They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit
Her bra smell, his card say, ""Aw Hell!""
Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel
Keep a cooker where the jar fell
And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell
Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears
Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares
The odd pair swears and God fears
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years
I wrote this note around New Year's
Off a couple of shots and a few beers, but who cares?
Enough about me, it's about the beats
Not about the streets and who food he 'bout to eat
A rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical
Whether is it animal, vegetable or mineral
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical
And proceed to move the crowd like a old negro spiritual
For a mil', do a commercial for Mello Yello
Tell them devils, ""Hell no, sell y'all own Jello""
We hollow krills, she swallow pills
He follow flea collar three dollar bills
And squealed for halal veal, if y'all appeal
Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal
Twirl a L after every meal (""Food!"")
What up? To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up
And keep a shirt on, at least a button-up
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?
Out-of-work jerks since they shut down Chippendales
They chippin' nails, DOOM tippin' scales
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales
This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail
Dippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale
Light the doobie 'til it glow like a ruby
After which, they couldn't find the Villain, like Scooby
He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit
Overproof drunk shit, but who'd'a thunk it?
Punk, try and ask why ours be better
Could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater
Yes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD, nude
(""We need food!"")56Embed","“Beef Rapp,” the first track off of MM.. Food.
Written and produced by MF DOOM, (a.k.a. Metal Fingers when he’s producing).

This ditty here is about those rappers who make their living from “beef raps,” fights started with other rappers to boost sales. Battle raps are a true part of Hip Hop, and true battles are things of legend (e.g. MC Shan vs. KRS-One, LL Cool J vs. Kool Moe D, Hammer, Ice-T and Canibus, etc.). DOOM doesn’t care too much for it though, as he explains in XXL Magazine:


Oh yeah, “Beef Rapp.”[sic] Good song. Good choice. I just think it’s a funny word. I don’t get angry at this point, so [rap beef] is like whatever. The challenge is what it’s about with me, the challenge of being such a picky topic to handle. Also, the double entendre with the word beef, the way it’s perceived in the street world and it’s a food—a so-called food—so how it’s perceived in the nutritional realm. The fact that there’s two things that correlate there gave me enough metaphors to play with. But it’s all fun. I always do it with something that’s fun. Anger is something I don’t deal with.

It had to be two things: It had to be a food people could relate to and there had to be another play on the word. For instance, I’d say kon queso, like cheese. Everyone knows “cheese” has a reference in the street, as money and whatnot. And cheese is something that’s always added in addition to a cheeseburger or a beef patty. So it’s about finding a word where you can take two different approaches to it.","September 2, 2003"

Yo! (Yo!)

What up, nigga? (Ain't nuttin; what's the word?)
What's cracking, boy? (Same ol' shit, kid)
Man (Different day, you know?)
These rap snitches, man, shit is bugged out, man
What the fuck, man? (Shit, you telling me)
Niggas running their mouth, telling e'rything, e'rything (Critical)

Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
""Do you see the perpetrator?"" Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years, uh
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
""Do you see the perpetrator?"" Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years

Type profile low, like A in Paid in Full
Attract heavy cash cause the game's centrifugal
Mr. Fantastik, long dough like elastic
Guard my life with twin Glocks that's made out of plastic
Can't stand a brown-nosing nigga, fake ass bastard
Admiring my style, tour bus through Manhattan
Plotting, plan the quickest, my flow's the sickest
My hoes be the thickest, my dro the stickiest
Street nigga, stamped and bonafide
When beef jump niggas come get me cause they know I ride
True to the ski mask, New York's my origin
Play a fake gangsta like an old accordion
According to him, when the D's rushed in
Complication from the wire, testimony was thin
Caused his man to go up north, the ball hit 'em again
Lame rap snitch nigga even told on the Mexican
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
""Do you see the perpetrator?"" Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
""Do you see the perpetrator?"" Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years

True, there's rules to this shit, fools dare care
Everybody wanna rule the world with tears for fear
Yeah, yeah, tell 'em tell it on the mountain hill
Running up they mouth bill, everybody doubting still
Informer, keep it up and get tested
Pop through your bubble vest or double-breasted
He keep a lab down south in the little beast
So much heat you woulda thought it was the Middle East
A little grease always keeps the wheels a-spinning
Like sitting on twenty threes to get the squealers grinning
Hitting on many trees, feel real linen
Spitting on enemies, get the steel for tin men
Where no brains but gum flap
He said his gun clap, then he fled after one slap (Pap!)
Son, shut your trap, save it for the bitches
Mmm, delicious, rapp snitch knishes
You know what I'm saying? (It's terrible)
Crazy, man, I'm just analyzing this whole game
This is bugged out, man, niggas is snitching
Telling on they own self (It's a horror, yo)
Fuck around and get everybody bagged, man
(Atrocities) Fuck around and get yo mama bagged, nigga
You know your grandmama used to be bootlegging

MF DOOM,That’s That,"That’s That Lyrics
Already woke, spared a joke, barely spoke, rarely smoke
Stared at folks when properly provoked, mirror broke
Here, share a strawberry morning
Gone, an more important spawning, torn in, poor men sworn in
Cornish hens switching positions
Auditioning morticians, saw it in a vision, ignoring prison
Ignoramuses enlist and sound dumb
Found 'em drowned in cow's dung, crowns flung
Rings a Tinkerbell, sing for things that's frail as a fingernail
Bring a scale, stale ginger lingers
Seven figures invigor
Nigga, fresh from out the jail, alpha male
Sickest ninja injury this century, enter plea
Lend sympathy to limper Simple Simon rhymin' emcees
Trees is free, please leave a key
These meager fleas, he's the breeze
And she's the bee's knees for sheez, G's of G's
Seize property, shopper sprees, chop the cheese
Drop degrees to stop diseases, gee-whiz, Pa!
DOOM rock grammar like the kumbaya
Mama was a ho hopper, papa was a rolling stone
Star like Obama, pull a card like oh, drama
Civil liberties
These little titties' abilities riddle me, middle C (Ahhhh!)
Mmm, give a MC a rectal hysterectomy
Lecture on removal of the bowels, foul technically
Don't expect to see the recipe
Until we receive the check as well as the collection fee
More wreck than Section Z, what you expect to get for free?
Shit from me, history
The key, plucked it off the mayor
Chucked it in the ol' tar pit off La Brea, player
They say he's gone too far
DOOM'll catch em after Jumah on cue lacka!
Do whatcha gotta do, grarrrr
The rumors are not true, got two ma
No prob, got the job, hot bod, heartthrob
Scotchguard the bar with cotton swabs, dart lob
Bake a cake, sweet, Jamaica trade in treats on the beach
Make her skeet til her feets meet
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did you miss these rhymes when I was gone?
As you listen to these crazy tracks
Check them stats then you know where I'm at
And that's that

Look, there's Doom now!
I followed him to the studio, but I was too late to stop him
That's right! You'll never stop me!
You're dead! You're all dead! Doom!51Embed","This song is often regarded as one of DOOM’s most impressive tracks due to the rhyme density on display. While the lyrics are somewhat abstract, the primary theme on display is braggadocio: dismissal of weaker MCs and the supremacy of DOOM as a vocalist.

The instrumental contains a sample of Galt MacDermot’s “Princess Gika”, off Woman Is Sweeter soundtrack. The sample was suggested to DOOM by then general manager of Stones Throw Records, Egon, who is a great crate digger. The instrumental had previously been released as the song “Styrax Gum,” off DOOM’s collection of beats, Special Herbs.","March 24, 2009"
Cold Crush Brothers,"Fresh, Wild, Fly and Bold","Fresh, Wild, Fly and Bold Lyrics
Well, I'm fresh 'cause I'm the best
And I get wild when I'm riled
I never get passed by 'cause I'm fly
And I'ma put you on hold 'cause I'm bold
And Charlie Chase will last 'cause he's fast
And Tony Tone got pull 'cause he's original
The Cold Crush is on 'cause we perform
And even in a storm we'll keep you warm
Hey crew (Yeah, Cap?)
We gonna need a little scratch for the rap now
Tone and Chase (Yeah crew?)
You're the DJs, whatcha gonna do?

Guess what y'all, I'm fresh
What makes you think so, Cap?
Because I look so good, and I'm the lord of rap
How fresh?
So fresh that when I was young
I learned to drive women crazy with my tongue
Now that's fresh

I get wild
What makes you say that, L?
Because it don't take much to make me yell
How wild?
So wild, that when I start to break
Hey, you better step back and let me flake
Now that's wild
Well, I'm fly
Who told you that, Easy?
Your girl, his mother, and my lady
How fly?
So fly, sometimes it seems
All I got to do is smile, and I get screams
Now that's fly

I'm bold
What gives you that impression, Kay?
Because I don't care what nobody say
How bold?
So bold, I smack a man with his gun
And kiss his woman, diss his mother, and don't even run
Now that's bold

Fresh, wild, fly and bold
And we'll be that way till we grow old
For the rest of our life, as long as we live
We'll keep using those adjectives
That do describe the heart-breaking tribe
That do permit us to go with
A musical flow that makes you say ""ho""
With a fresh rap style to make you go wild
Cold Crush, us, good in the clutch
And if you don't believe we're real, then touch us
The Cold Crush
Fresh, wild, fly and bold
Yes, we're what makes the Crush so cold
Our rhymes will freeze all fake MCs
That don't say please before they seize
Rhymes and routines that we make up
You can't pour juice in a fake cup
They cannot write so they just rob
But a biter can't do a real rapper's job
But if you're hard-headed, and you still think so
Grab your rhymes and your mic and go for what you know
Kick it, kick it, kick it, kick it
Two times

My name is Kay Gee, better known as the Al-
-Mighty, and with the three I'm sure you'll call
On us when your ear is in need for a treat
And if you don't know the Kay, that's who you got to meet
I'm fourth in line and in due time
And every rapper in the business will know that I'm
Serious about this and I don't play
I told a sucker MC that just the other day
'Cause I learned the ropes and paid my dues
I'm going for the gold, no way that I can lose
It's Easy A.D. that you wanted to be
Ever since you saw me emcee
You wanted to be fine, to learn how to rhyme
Even wanted your braids as long as mine
But the rhymes I write are a real delight
If you're a true MC, you would not bite
On me or them, just sit down and
Write a rhyme with your mind, paper or pen
But you can't, so you don't, you will and you won't
Take heed with me and read what I wrote

When I'm on the stage I go a little berserk
Start breaking, flaking, you know I do work
I try to get you on mine when I deliver my lines
Cause it's about making rhymes like no one else can design
I do everything I can to make myself better
Live on a steady diet of stages and meda'
Know all the celebs, so when I'm in the crowd
They surround me like the press, scream my name out loud
Say ""Yo J.D.L., what's happenin'?
Where have you been? When are you rocking again?""
And when I'm bopping away, I hear a lot of them say
""Damn, I wanna be like the L one day""

So many biting MCs, you're all a pain in my neck, ha
They should be sending me your royalty check
You just bit my rhymes, didn't pay no tax
Copied the music from someone else, put it on wax
I'm mad as hell, cause it's bound to sell
And you be biting what I'm writing, and people can't tell
You change it around, disguise the sound
With no prior desire to write, that's why I frown
On those of you that don't strive to
Be original and write like the Captain do
So put your teeth away, and try someday
And you can quote it, cause I wrote it only yesterday

(Fresh!) And unless I miss my guess
I'm the best, oh yes, because I wrote the test
(Wild!) Honey child on the top of the pile
Once in a while I crack a smile
(Fly!) Know why? Cause 'til the day I die
I'll always be the guy you won't pass by
(Bold!) So cold and so hard to hold
And when they made the Cold Crush, they broke the mold
Hah-huh!

Man, let's get outta here, it's Miller time
Word!
Huh!
Hah!Embed","A record that doesn’t lack in self-confidence, the Cold Crush Brothers go line-for-line talking about how fly they are, how the ladies love them, and how they don’t care about what other MC’s are doing, because they are here with the new rap style. While these topics do sound similar to the braggadocious rap we hear today, Cold Crush doesn’t talk about how much money they have, but they brag about how good of MC’s they are. This speaks on the times, before rap was mainstream and as embraced as it is today, rap wasn’t about money, but the bars. The rhymes. The groups.",1984

By this tough voice, all the ladies can tell

The hut, the maker, the heart, the breaker
On any stage, I'm the number one flaker
Do it like this and you will see
Nobody in the place can flake like me
'Cause I'm the L, baby, baby, the L, baby, baby
The one who rocks you all swell, baby, baby
Well it's '82 and everything is fine
But I still got a thought in my mind
That do you still listen to an MC rhyme?
Well if you do (Well I'll bet you too)
That a lotta them duck MCs are through
And if you still got money and you wanna bet
Well I'll bet a hundred dollars I'm not whipped yet

Never put to shame because I have a brain
Supreme Easy A.D. is the name that I claim
Never brag about my crew but you know what we can do
Don't have no LP, but we're not blue
Our rhymes are the tools to set the mood
If you won't bother us, we won't bother you
We're the Cold Crush crew, that's what I said
All you wack MCs, get it through your heads
As you listen to me speak as I reach my peak
Because I never bite a rhyme, I never repeat
Because I'm Easy A, going all the way
Keeping up the funky pace to the break of day
And then you get up, a-then ya get down

You rock to the beat 'cause I'm so sweet
I'm guaranteed to rock the house and get you out of your seat
Well I'm Supreme A.D. as you can trust
Rockin' to the funky beat I'm the serious must
I'm down with the four, I'm down with the four
I'm down with the four known as the Cold Crush

Rock to the beat to the break of day
And rock to the beat and listen to what I say
Walkin' down the street and I met this girl
Told the girl what it's gonna be
Let's go to my house and community
Then I hit her with a rap that was so bad
I took the girl up to my pad
Got home, she start buggin' on me
I said to myself ""I know this can't be""
The girl turned around and then she broke
And I just laughed like it was some kind of joke
(She said) Baby be calm, (She said) baby be cool
Let me teach you the golden rule
But yes my mellow do y'know what I said? (What?)
Laid her monkey ass (What?), shoved her monkey ass (What?)
Threw her monkey ass in my waterbed
I said Caz, my mell-ow
Get on the mic and serve 'em well
It was a long time ago but I'll never forget
I got caught in the bed with a girl named Yvette
Well I was scared like hell but I got away
That's why I'm here tellin' you today
I was outside of my school sniffing up some rocks
A crowd of people all around listenin' to my box
Just me and the fans, and some guys from my crew
Chillin' hard 'cause we had nothin' better to do
It was me, the L, the A, and the All
And then I slipped away to make a phone call
To this very day it was a move I regret
But I didn't know then so I called Yvette
I said, ""Hello pretty mama, it's your lover man""
She said, ""Baby, come on over as quick as you can""
I said, ""I can't come now, someone's comin' to get me""
Then she said, ""I'm all alone, there's nobody with me""
Thought for a second, ""Oh shit, she's alone!""
Then I was knockin' at her door 'fore she hung up the phone
She let me in the house and gave me a kiss
And said, ""Give me that thing that you know I missed""
And so we went into her room and we got high
But she couldn't keep her hand from off my fly
So I made her lock the door, went to check it
When I came back in the girl was naked
That was my cue to do the do
I took my clothes off and started on the pooh
Well I was tearin' shit up, then 'bout a quarter to three
She said, ""Caz! Somebody's comin'!""
I said, ""Yeah, me!""
Then the door bust open, and there was her folks
I thought, ""Damn, they coulda waited - said damn, they coulda waited, said damn, they coulda waited 'til I finished my strokes""
Her mother was in shock, her father reached on the shelf
Pulled down a .45, I almost shit on myself!
Said, ""Please don't shoot!"" and pleaded my case
Said, ""You'd have done the same thing if you was in my place
But if you spare my life, believe me friend!
You'll never see me 'round your daughter again""
Don't ask me why but he let me leave
I ran 26 blocks, then I stopped to breathe
Gave thanks to God he wasn't too upset
Went home and thought about poor Yvette
He must of beat her ass with everything I assume
'Cause I could hear the girl screamin' all the way in my room
Even though I don't see Yvette no more
Well I know she ain't as fine, I know she ain't as fine
I know ain't half as fine as she was before
So J.D.L. ha, you know my voice is sore
Homeboy, get on the mic and rock once more
Well I'm here to be known and I'm known to be
As an electrifying prince of poetry
You listen to my rhymes that you never ever heard
So stick around...2Embed",?,1983

Cold Crush Brothers,Weekend,"Weekend Lyrics
Everybody listen to this
The weekend's coming so don't you dare miss
You're gonna regret if you're not on the scene
And then you'll get so mad it'll make you scream

Everyone give us your attention please
Especially those of you who like parties
It's a message that we would like to extend
About why everybody love the what? Weekend!
Cause there's a time to work and a time to play
But you can't do both effectively in one day
So without delay, without further ado
Let the four run down this week for you
We're the Cold Crush Four, giving, giving you more
And we just came to say
Oooh-ahh, what a relief it is
When the weekend comes your way
So grab a chair from anywhere
And listen while we speak
Cause the Four's gonna start this record off
With the first day of the week

Monday!
The train was late and you hardly ate
Plus you wish you'd stayed in bed
Tuesday!
You ran a game on your favorite dame
And then she messed up your head
Wednesday!
You try to be cool and stay out of school
Yeah, you're fronting and showboating
Thursday!
Now your mind's in doubt, you can't figure out
Why you're not gonna get promoted
Friday!
After work is through, you sleep for a few
Until you hear somebody say
""Wake up, wake up, now don't you know
The weekend's when we play""
This is Chase with the bass
Tone, leave the girl alone

Friday and Saturday night, everybody's gonna show
At the place where all the fly people go
You been working at school or your occupation
Now it's about time for some recreation
Slip on your shirt and designer jeans
Say the ones that are tight at the hip and the seams
Then you shoot out the door like you're running a race
And then you finally arrive at the Cold Crush place
And...

You can't believe your eyes, 'cause
The party's packed and jumping
That funky bass is thumping
And the way the music rocks your mind
Ooh girl, it's really something
It's a place where you can dance
You can even find romance
And I know you can do it if you
Give yourself a chance
So-so-so-so, so just dance
Almighty all nighty, ha ha ha
JDL, well...

We gonna let you know, we gonna let you see
What we're gonna do at the party
Grandmaster Caz, I got lovin' to spare
I'm gonna chill with the ladies when I get there
Well I'm Jerry Dee or JDL
And when I get there I'm gonna rock it well
Easy AD not talkin' no jive
And the party's gonna swing when I arrive
Well I'm the Almighty and when I get there
I wanna hear everybody cheer, cheer, cheer
And we're the Cold Crush Four
With Tone and Chase
So c'mon everybody in the party place
Just throw your hands in the air
And just wave them like you just don't care
And if you're on the go cause we told you so
Somebody say Hoooo (Hooo!)
Hooo-hoooo! (Hoooo-hooo!)
Ho-ho-ho! (Ho-ho-ho!)

Now the lights are flashin', the people are dancing
The guys are looking out for some serious action
It's richer than a diamond, finer than a pearl
And this is what happens when boy meets girl
Introduce yourself as whoever you are
Then you grab her by the hand and lead her to the bar
Offer her a drink, maybe a cigarette
'Til she insists conversation is all you're gonna get
Try another approach and ask her for a dance
Your time is runnin' out, this is your last chance
And then you sweep her off her feet with your prowess
And then you know you got it made — finally, success
Cause we rock the best and the Four is fresh
Oooh man that party was smokin'...

When the jam is over you head for the stairs
All the girls and the guys are leaving in pairs
You had such a good time, you wish you could stay
Now it's time to catch the bus, train, or OJ
You get to your house and pull out your key
You're tired as hell, you want to sleep 'til three
Wake up Sunday, wipe the sleep from your eyes
And go out in the sun for some exercise
Play ball, roller skate, or visit a friend
And go home and think about the next weekendEmbed",?,"January 1, 1982"
Depeche Mode,Enjoy the Silence,"Enjoy the Silence Lyrics
Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me
Can't you understand? Oh, my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm


Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense, words are trivial
Pleasures remain, so does the pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm


Enjoy the silence50Embed","“Enjoy The Silence” is Depeche Mode’s highest charting song in the US and one of several top ten hits in their homeland the UK. It won “Best British Single” at the 1991 Brit Awards.

In 2010, Pitchfork placed it at #15 on their Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s. Rolling Stone described it as “sensually serene”

Vocalist Dave Gahan explained that “Enjoy The Silence” began as a “very slow, ballad-y couple of verses” but bandmate Alan Wilder and producer Flood converted it into the danceable new wave hit it became. At first, songwriter Martin Gore was initially not on board with the uptempo rewrite.

I thought the very nature of the song was, you know, enjoy the silence, so it ought to have a very serene atmosphere. It took me a while to get used to the idea, but as we took it further that way with the guitar riff, it really pulled together.","February 5, 1990"

It also reached the top 20 in several countries overseas and became Warner Bros. Records' biggest-selling 12"" single in its 40+ year history. Rolling Stone later named “Personal Jesus” as one of the 500 greatest songs of all time in 2011.

According to vocalist Dave Gahan, Priscilla Presley calls her husband Elvis “her own personal Jesus” in her book Elvis & Me and that is what inspired songwriter Martin Gore to write this song. Gore confirms the track was inspired by Priscilla Presley’s idolatry of her husband. Taking the lyrics literally, “Personal Jesus” is about a person who offers relief through a second-rate confessional via the telephone.","March 19, 1990"
Depeche Mode,Policy of Truth,"Policy of Truth Lyrics
You had something to hide
Should have hidden it, shouldn't you?
Now you're not satisfied
With what you're being put through

It's just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth
On the policy of truth

Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilised
You will always wonder how
It could have been if you'd only lied

It's too late to change events
It's time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth

Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Now you're standing there tongue-tied
You'd better learn your lesson well
Hide what you have to hide
And tell what you have to tell

You'll see your problems multiplied
If you continually decide
To faithfully pursue
The policy of truth

Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before


Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore

Rolling Stone described the track as “otherworldly and bluesy”. NPR felt the song pairs “seductive pop hooks with darkly romantic content.”

As of May 2017, “Policy Of Truth” is only Depeche Mode single to do better in the US than the UK.

Lyrically, its theme is: once you have confessed to a wrongdoing, you can’t take it back, and have to suffer the consequences.","March 19, 1990"

The song is produced by Simian Mobile Disco’s James Ford but it maintains Depeche Mode’s signature sound.

It is not the first time Depeche Mode touch political themes in their songs. ‘Everything Counts’, ‘Get The Balance Right’, ‘People Are People’, ‘Master And Servant’, ‘New Dress’ are all political songs.

The theme of the song brings back the more political side of the band and it encourages people to start a revolution.



You can sense a kind of deception in the song lyrics as Dave goes on describing all the things we (as a society) are suffering and how we haven’t done anything yet.

Dave Gahan revealed on Rolling Stone that Martin L. Gore’s is beign sarcastic on the song:

Taylor Swift,All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) [From the Vault],"All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it193Embed","Widely regarded as one of Swift’s best songs, “All Too Well” sees her picking up shards of memories after a gut-wrenching breakup. She jumps through time to reflect on her best and worst memories with her ex, making the listener feel as though they were there with the couple.

Swift told Pop Dust that she began writing the song in a soundcheck for her 2011 tour in support of Speak Now. Co-writer Liz Rose explained that the song was initially 10-15 minutes long before she helped Swift pare it down, and Swift shared some of the original lyrics in a deluxe edition of her 2019 album, Lover.

Melodically, this version of “All Too Well” is more subdued than the version we hear on the album. This change is evident throughout the song. This version begins with a saccharine melody before building up to a steady drum beat, while the original is heavily backed by guitar.

Lyrically, the songs are also different. This ten minute version is more vitriolic and bitter, while the album version is bittersweet. The metaphors in Verse 2 are reminiscent of folklore/evermore era Taylor, rather than Red era, with comparisons to bolder themes like death and tragedy rather than just the specific memories present in the original.

Many believe Swift took inspiration from her relationship with actor Jake Gyllenhaal — the secret message “Maple Lattes” is hidden in the song’s liner notes, and the two shared those coffees in November 2010. In a 2015 interview with Howard Stern, Gyllenhaal claimed to not know that Swift wrote a song about him, though she seemingly told Vulture he reached out to her after hearing the album.

“All Too Well” was the fourth song to contribute to Swift’s “Track Five pattern,” a pattern fans have noted where she puts one of the most emotive songs on an album as the fifth track. Previous examples were “Cold As You,” “White Horse,” and “Dear John.”

As a tribute to her fans and the massive impact this song had on her personal and professional life, Swift wrote and produced a short film for the song, starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien.","November 12, 2021"
Taylor Swift,​cardigan,"​cardigan Lyrics
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite156Embed","Accompanied by the release of her project written and recorded during the lockdown due to COVID-19, “cardigan” is the lead single from Taylor Swift’s eighth studio album, folklore.

Its music video — which was written and directed by Taylor and shot during the COVID-19 pandemic — finds Taylor shifting through different places by the magic of playing the piano. She revealed in a Tweet that everyone who was on-set took extra precautions to prevent the spread of the virus:

The entire shoot was overseen by a medical inspector, everyone wore masks, stayed away from each other, and I even did my own hair, makeup, and styling.

“cardigan” is believed to be the first part of folklore’s “Teenage Love Triangle,” told from the point of view of Betty. The storyline is followed by “august” and “betty.” Swift explained in a livechat the night of folklore’s release:

There’s a collection of three songs I refer to as The Teenage Love Triangle. These three songs explore a love triangle from all three people’s perspectives at different times in their lives.","July 24, 2020"

You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

Ooh, ooh, ooh

I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you

We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

Ah, ah103Embed","“exile” describes two ex-lovers seeing each other following a break-up. Justin Vernon describes feelings of confusion about how quickly a lover moved on, while Swift offers a perspective about repeated warning signs that the relationship was no longer working. It’s also worth noting the contrast between Vernon’s rougher voice and Swift’s smoother one, which mirrors the contrast between their views of the relationship.

The song prompted many comparisons to Swift’s 2012 track “The Last Time,” another song that discusses the downfall of a relationship. Much like “exile,” Swift and featured artist Gary Lightbody’s voices contrast in tone, highlighting their differences.

“exile” is one of many folklore songs to contain a movie motif — other songs to do so include “the 1,” “this is me trying,” and “hoax.” It’s also her first collaboration with Bon Iver, who she called one of her “musical heroes” in an Instagram post announcing folklore.","July 24, 2020"
Taylor Swift,Lover,"Lover Lyrics
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover127Embed","The title track of Lover was first unveiled in Swift’s September 2019 Vogue cover story, along with a pair of lyrics from its bridge. The interviewer described the song as a “romantic, haunting, waltzy, singer-songwritery nugget.” Swift announced the song’s release date during an acceptance speech at the 2019 Teen Choice Awards. Three days later, the song appeared on iTunes, revealing that it’s the third track on the album.

The song is a romantic track dedicated to Swift’s partner of three years, Joe Alwyn. It takes a wedding-like perspective on their relationship and shares information about their romance. A Twitter user who attended one of the secret sessions alleged that “‘Lover’ is Taylor’s favorite [original] song of all time,” having asked her directly during a Q&A.

On the day of its release, “Lover” reached number #1 on the US iTunes charts, making it her 35th song to do so. With this milestone, she extends her record as the female with the most #1 singles in iTunes' history.

The music video for the song was released on August 22, 2019, immediately following Swift’s Lover’s Lounge on YouTube. It features Swift and her love interest in a house inside a snow globe, illustrating the ups and downs of a relationship in progress. During Swift’s livestream, she further revealed that the concept for the music video originated from a lyric in her 1989 song, “You Are In Love”:

And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, ‘round and 'round","August 16, 2019"

It is a self-empowerment anthem that calls out haters. Katy has mentioned that her album is about a “360° liberation” and this song is about escaping pointless negativity. The central hook uses the image of a basketball player consistently scoring points, imitating the ‘swish’ sound of the hoop’s net.

Fans speculated the song to be a response to Taylor Swift’s 2014 hit “Bad Blood,” citing many lyrical references.

This was later confirmed when she starred in James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke interview. Katy explained:

She started it and it’s time for her to finish it. Now, there is the law of cause and effect. You do something, there’s going to be a reaction, and trust me, daddy, there’s going to be a reaction.

The song was indirectly confirmed days prior by EDM artist and ex-Taylor flame Calvin Harris, who said he “wasn’t involved” in a now-deleted tweet.","May 19, 2017"

Don't walk away (Walk away)

When asked about “Creep” in 1993, Yorke said:

I have a real problem being a man in the ‘90s… Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you’re in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do… It comes back to the music we write, which is not effeminate, but it’s not brutal in its arrogance. It is one of the things I’m always trying: To assert a sexual persona and on the other hand trying desperately to negate it.

Jonny Greenwood said the song was in fact a happy song about “recognizing what you are”.

Notable covers include those by The Pretenders, Carrie Manolakos, Macy Gray, Lea Michele and Dean Geyer, as part of Glee, Vega Choir, Prince, The Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps, and most recently, Kimberly Nichole, who performed a very strong cover of this song on the 2015 season of The Voice.

Despite, or perhaps because of, the popularity of the song, Radiohead grew to hate “Creep” and have rarely played it live since the OK Computer tour. “My Iron Lung”, written in 1994 and later released on The Bends, is about the song.","September 21, 1992"

Thom Yorke’s strained, lackadaisical vocals are at once warm and sinister, echoing the delusions of an addict in the midst of a narcotic meltdown.

The song’s lyrics tie in with a number of themes common in OK Computer, including insanity, violence, slogans, and political objection to capitalism.

Yorke’s lyrics were based on an unpleasant experience at a Los Angeles bar during which he was surrounded by strangers high on cocaine. In particular, Yorke was frightened by a woman who became violent after someone spilled a drink on her.

The woman inspired the line “kicking squealing Gucci little piggy” in the song’s second section. Yorke described her as “inhuman”, and said

[…]there was a look in this woman’s eyes that I’d never seen before anywhere… Couldn’t sleep that night because of it.

In an issue of Rolling Stone, the band has compared the song to other multi-part rock pieces by famous artists, and tackled the often-raised comparison with progressive rock. Thom Yorke:

It was 50 percent “Bohemian rhapsody,” if I could ever get that many vocals together, and 50 percent “Happiness Is a Warm Gun.”

Ed O'Brien:

To me, the song sounded like Queen meets the Pixies. […] People thought it was prog, but prog always took itself so seriously. And “Paranoid Android,” there’s a kind of serious message in there, but it’s kind of cartoon-like.

Jonny Greenwood:

There’s a Mellotron on it. I remember hearing a Genesis record and thinking the Mellotron sounded amazing, so I stole it. It was either “Nursery Cryme  or ”Selling England by the Pound“. It didn’t sound like any other keyboard. Instead there was a choir, and a weird, fucked-up sort of choir. I love the fact that the notes run out after a few seconds. Some relative of the inventor was trying to remake them and had a few. They came with the tapes in and it turned out they all belonged to Tangerine Dream, which is getting into prog territory.

The song was also used as the ending theme for the anime series Ergo Proxy.","May 21, 1997"

Billie Eilish,​bad guy,"​bad guy Lyrics
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad339Embed","“bad guy” is a playful, bass-heavy track that sees Eilish taunting her lover, flaunting her tough nature while questioning his own.

Billie Eilish,​everything i wanted,"​everything i wanted Lyrics
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?300Embed","“everything i wanted” sees Billie recalling a nightmare she experienced where she committed suicide and saw all her friends and fans turn their backs on her. The lyrics showcase Billie’s strong relationship with her brother FINNEAS, as he’s the one she goes to for support when dealing with these types of problems.

The song is Billie Eilish’s first single released after her debut album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?. The song was announced on November 11, 2019 via Twitter and Instagram stories. It had also been previously teased via Twitter on November 5th, 2019. On November 12, 2019, one day before its release, Eilish teased a 12-second snippet of the track via Instagram.

Billie Eilish,Happier Than Ever,"Happier Than Ever Lyrics
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Fuck you)

It marks the end of Imagine Dragons' self-imposed hiatus that started in 2016. The song acts as the title for their documentary surrounding LGBT youth and the Mormon church.

Imagine Dragons,Demons,"Demons Lyrics
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes194Embed","While the fast-paced verses of “Whatever it Takes” propels Imagine Dragons into new territory, the big and booming chorus retains a sense of their signature sound.

Adele,Hello,"Hello Lyrics
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Ooh, anymore

Hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

255Embed","Almost five years after her groundbreaking 21, Adele examines the past and tries to right her wrongs on “Hello.” On the surface, the song appears to be about a break-up from long ago, but the song can also be interpreted as Adele’s attempt at reconciliation with her former self. In a tweet, Adele called 21 a “break-up record” and 25 a “make-up record.”

Adele revealed the broad inspiration for the song:

No, it’s not about anyone specifically. It’s about friends, ex-boyfriends, it’s about myself, it’s about my family. It’s also about my fans as well.

A day before the release, Zane Lowe interviewed Adele about her future goals, touring, the album, and the “Hello” music video. Although “Hello” was released on October 23, 2015, a portion of the song was first featured during a commercial break on the UK’s X Factor on October 18, 2015.

The accompanying music video broke the Vevo record for the most views in 24 hours with 27.7 million total. Taylor Swift previously held the record with her video for “Bad Blood”, which had 20.1 million views in a single day. “Hello” was directed by Xavier Dolan and was the first music video to be shot by IMAX cameras.

In the US, “Hello” debuted at number 1 on the Hot 100, selling a whopping 1,112,000 downloads in its first week, almost doubling Flo Rida’s previous sales record (636,000 with “Right Round”.) The track significantly broke various streaming records after being replayed 61 million times in its first week.

In an interview with i-D, Adele contextualizes “Hello”:

The song is about hurting someone’s feelings but it’s also about trying to stay in touch with myself, which sometimes can be a little bit hard to do,“ she explains. ""It’s about a yearning for the other side of me. When I’m away, I really, really miss my life at home. The way that I feel when I’m not in England, is…” (she pauses) “desperation. I can’t breathe anywhere else.” Why? “I dunno. I’m so attached to my whole life here. I get worked up that I’m missing out on things. So ‘Hello’ is about wanting to be at home and wanting to reach out to everyone I’ve ever hurt – including myself – and apologise for it.","October 23, 2015"

And the highest hopes

Adele,Someone Like You,"Someone Like You Lyrics

That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind, I'll find someone like you

The track was inspired by the broken relationship that inspired most of 21. As the closing track of the album, lyrically, it speaks of Adele coming to terms with it. She wrote it with Dan Wilson.

The single is one of Adele’s most commercially successful singles. It became Adele’s first number-one single in the UK and second in the USA. As of 2015, it is the third most downloaded single of all time in the UK and the fourth best-selling single of the 21st century.

Fun fact: This was the first pure-piano ballad to ever top the Billboard Hot 100. At the time of “Someone Like You’s” ascension, there were 1,008! The second was Bruno Mars' “When I Was Your Man.”

Adele,When We Were Young,"When We Were Young Lyrics
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
'Cause I still care, do you still care?
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young92Embed","Newly-returned pop icon Adele worked with songwriter Tobias Jesso Jr. and producer Ariel Rechtshaid on the “‘70s styled shimmery disco ballad” “When We Were Young,” the second single from her album 25. She indicated in her Rolling Stone feature that the Elton John inspired ballad was her favorite on 25.

The piano used on the recording belonged to iconic minimalist composer Philip Glass. The piano is in Jesso’s grandmother’s house. Adele explained, “It used to be this mad party house and for some reason [Glass’s] piano was there so we wrote the song on that.”

In a town hall interview for SiriusXM’s The Spectrum, Adele described the setting of “When We Were Young” as a party with old friends and acquaintances, with “everyone that you’ve ever fallen out with, everyone that you’ve ever loved, everyone that you’ve never loved…And you’re all thrown together at this party when you’re like 50, and it doesn’t matter and you have so much fun and you feel like you’re 15 again.”","November 20, 2015"

The self-produced record finds Keem rapping about his “orange soda”—referring to the girl he’s attracted to. Keem talks to his significant other and addresses their relationship, which is troubled by her demands and by her friend’s interference.

A music video was released to complement the success of the single four months after the release of the song.","July 16, 2019"

I look at the hoes, they not at your shows
I look at your shows, they Oprah white

I'm VVS-ed up, precise in the cut
Did she get a nut? It's not about me
As long as you good, don't worry 'bout me
I'm telling my friends that you not a freak
My new Nia Long is Kaepernick strong
And she not afraid to get on one knee
I'm back at the crib, my memory deep
I think about mama, I'm Baby Hykeem
She got that tatted before I could read
I'm spiritual now, I pray in my sleep
Twenty years long, I never had dad
My dad was a fraud, I had to be tough
Twenty million, ho, that's not enough
Don't ask no questions, bitch, go add it up
I took the light to sacrifice
I sacrificed everything I need
I could probably fuck these bitches in my sleep

Stressing 'bout money, turned to other things

In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

426Embed","Royals is the lead single off Lorde’s 2012 breakout EP The Love Club. It debuted at #1 in New Zealand, and eventually topped the Billboard Hot 100, outranking Katy Perry’s “Roar” and Miley Cyrus’s “Wrecking Ball”.

The song has been praised for its minimalistic beat and mature lyrics, which detail the New Zealand native’s complicated relationship to media, fame, and decadent lifestyles.

Lorde described the song as a lighthearted critique of hip-hop culture and fashion – a stance that prompted some critical backlash. She explained in a 2013 interview:

I definitely wrote “Royals” with a lightness in mind….I was definitely poking fun at a lot of things that people take to be normal. I was listening to a lot of hip-hop and I kind of started to realize that to be cool in hip-hop, you have to have that sort of car and drink that sort of vodka and have that sort of watch, and I was like, “I’ve literally never seen one of those watches in my entire life.”","June 3, 2013"

The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room

Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes, as well
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell
We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there

So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing
For a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

After the music video debuted, Lorde posted on her Facebook:

this video was borne from a dream i had a few months ago about teenagers in their own world, a world with hierarchies and initiations, where the boy who was second in command had acne on his face, and so did the girl who was queen. i dreamt about this world being so different to anything anyone had ever seen, a dark world full of tropical plants and ruins and sweat. and of this world, i dreamt about tests that didn’t need to be passed in order to be allowed in: sometimes the person who loses is stronger.","September 13, 2013"
Lorde,Liability,"Liability Lyrics
Go for it
One, two

Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room
But all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek

They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone
The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
Till all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting, running through the night
But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

They're gonna watch me disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun145Embed","“Liability” is new territory for Lorde: it’s a soft, piano-driven ballad that’s far more personal than her previous work. Lorde herself described the song as “a strange part of [herself] for a lot of people to look at.”

She said further in an interview:

It’s kind of not really about anyone. It’s about me and just feeling the pressure of people finding it difficult to be friends with me- to be close to me. It was very much a product of me sitting alone in taxis and alone in my living room, and working out how to be my own best mate really.”

At a concert she said:

And this is a song that I wrote, and it marked a real turn for me. When we first started writing I was afraid of it. I thought it was corny and I was like “this is lame.” And then Jack was like, “this is straight up David Bowie chords.” And I was like, “oh yeah, okay.” I’d never really written anything about being my own best friend; about learning to take myself out to dinner, or sit in my house and, bake some weird cake, you know, about being out on my own and loving myself and respecting myself. Because it’s important, it’s very important, especially if you’re a strange, spiky, multicolored person like I am.""

The track is the second song released from Lorde’s sophomore album Melodrama. It was released abruptly on March 9, 2017, with no teasers or hints, unlike the debut of the album’s lead single “Green Light,” which was heavily promoted before its release one week prior to this song.

American songwriter and producer Jack Antonoff, who also co-produced and wrote “Green Light,” returns for “Liability” with the same credits.","March 9, 2017"

Well, those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor

But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But honey, I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

'Cause honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you

Well, those rumours, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?

Over those years, 2015 to 2017, Lorde became an adult and moved away from her “glossy idiot god” teenage-self and “crossed over” to adulthood. In a Facebook post on her 20th birthday, she described 2016 as a “colossal year.”

The song was promoted heavily via the website “imwaitingforit.com” which released teasers of the music video for the track for three days before it officially dropped. One day before the website’s launch, the first teaser was aired as a commercial across New Zealand, Lorde’s home country, and two days before the song dropped, she left clues around specific locations in Auckland, New Zealand, containing lyrics from the song and hints about its title.

It is Lorde’s first solo release since her 2013 debut album Pure Heroine, and since her curation of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay soundtrack. The single’s artwork was painted by Sam McKinniss.","March 2, 2017"
Raveena,If Only,"If Only Lyrics
When I was younger and I didn’t know better
Living with these wolves, hurting for pleasure
Some kind of angel took me out of the jungle
From your blue nights
Into sunlight

I sleep better at night without you around
Sometimes I still awake from you calling out

It’s too late to hold me
Too late to call me, too
You’re saying, ""If only
I could get over you""
Too late to know me
I’m going without you
You’re saying, ""If only
If only""

I said I’d meet you off the freeway, you’re lonely
You still don’t understand, a woman is holy
Your fake apologies would work on the old me
I get into my car
Leave you where you are
I sleep better at night without you around

The idea of honey, a free-flowing liquid that tempts people with its flavour and benefit, serves as a metaphor for the love and hard work needed to make a relationship taste as sweet as honey. Honey is hard to collect and takes a long time to create, just like Raveena’s ability to feel such a compelling connection.","May 2, 2018"

I wasn't in the mood for love
But you're quite funny
I see that you want me

It was kinda like a summer love
OJ and soda
So sweet it could kill you
I should check what I'm sippin' on

Don't play with my heart
I'm tryna be smart, but
I can't control this, hold on
I'm dizzy with headaches
I need a medic
Can you stay still while I'm like this?
Ah-oh, mmm, mmm

She's the kinda girl who will fuck you up
I'm the kinda girl who will love too much
Remember when I kissed all of the tears off your face?
You want endless care and infinite space, mmm

Don't play with my heart
I'm tryna be smart, but
I can't control this, hold on
I'm dizzy with headaches
I need a medic
Can you stay still while I'm like this?

(""Fuck all you hoes!"" Get a grip, motherfucker!)
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambú, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
You know very well (Yeah)
Who you are (Money, hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls, yeah, haha)
Reach for the stars (It's all good)
You had a goal (C'mon)
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty (Check it)

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
You know very well (C'mon)
Who you are (Bankrolls)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Clothes)
Reach for the stars (Mansions)
You had a goal
But not that many (It's all good)

I'll give you good and plenty ('94)

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty

It was one of the first mainstream rap songs about a rapper’s own rise to the top. But beyond that, this is also the story of how hip-hop itself became popular.

The title is derived from Mtume’s 1983 hit “Juicy Fruit” – Tony Humphries' “Fruity Instrumental” remix was sampled directly for the beat. The chorus of “Juicy” is a flip of Mtume’s chorus with slightly different words, sung by (uncredited) R&B girl group Total.","August 9, 1994"

The song marked a major stylistic change from the hardcore, aggressive style of Big’s early work. The music utilized a smoother West Coast g-funk aesthetic, while Big embraced a new ladies' man persona. Producer Easy Mo Bee remarked: “all of a sudden his voice calmed down. That became his new vocal style.”

“Big Poppa” peaked at #6 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart in March 1995. It was nominated for “Best Rap Solo Performance” and “Best Rap Song of the Year” at the 1996 Grammy Awards, and also went on to win at the Billboard Awards.

The title is based on one of the Notorious B.I.G.’s many nicknames. The line “I love when you call me Big Poppa” is sampled from his verse from the remix of Supercat’s song “Dolly My Baby”,“ released in 1993. The song also features a prominent sample from the The Isley Brothers‘ 1983 slow jam “Between The Sheets.”","February 20, 1995"

Oh, God damn
Nigga, do you know what time it is?
Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on?
You aight?
Ah, nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you?

When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell (What you talkin' 'bout, man?)
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies (Aw, man)
God'll probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice (You talkin' some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse (Ah)
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger (Yo, get a hold of yourself, nigga)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder; if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies (You're buggin', B)
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them? (Nah, nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit (Nigga, what the fuck?)
And squeeze until the bed's completely red (It's too late for this shit, man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't— I can't believe (Ayo, I'm on my way over there, man)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand
Nigga, talk to me please, man!
You see, it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back (Ayo, ayo, man, I'm out)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street? (I'ma call you when I get in the car)
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me (Ayo, where your girl at, man?)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone (Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga!)
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak (Ayo, you listenin' to me, motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (Ayo, c'mon, nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lyin' (Cut that), I'm sick of bitches hawkin' (Ayo)
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' (Nigga, yo, yo, Big! Ayo, chill!)

Ayo, Big! Ayo, Big!
Please hang up and try your call again
Please hang up— Is a recording250Embed","In this final track off of The Notorious B.I.G.’s classic debut album, Ready to Die, Biggie calls up Puff Daddy in the middle of the night to explain that he’s about to commit suicide. In one, long verse, he describes how he feels unloved and expresses guilt for all the crimes he’s committed, while Puff tries to talk him out of killing himself in the song’s ad-libs.

The telephone effect used on Puffy’s vocals, as well as other sound effects—e.g. gunshots and Big’s body falling to the floor—make the track both cinematic and haunting. Despite Puff’s pleas, Big pulls the trigger at the end of the track. Biggie’s fictional death directly ties into his follow-up album, March 1997’s Life After Death.

This conceptual track became even more significant after The Notorious B.I.G. was murdered in a drive-by shooting on March 9, 1997.","September 13, 1994"

The song’s hook interpolates Slick Rick’s lyrics from the 1985 hip-hop classic “La Di Da Di,” while the beat is built around a sample from “Rise,” the 1979 #1 hit by jazz-fusion trumpeter Herb Alpert.

A funky party song filled with boasts, pick-up lines, and pop culture references, “Hypnotize” remains one of Biggie’s best known hits. The song’s action-packed music video is one of the most iconic of the 1990s.

On April 26, 1997, “Hypnotize” became the second single to ever debut at #2 on Billboard’s Hot 100 (the first was Bone Thugs-N-Harmony’s “Tha Crossroads” one year earlier). It went #1 the following week, tying Bone Thugs and The Beatles for the fastest rise to the top of the chart.

“Hypnotize” replaced Puff Daddy’s “Can’t Nobody Hold Me Down” at #1, marking Bad Boy’s second chart-topper. It remained at #1 for three weeks, until it was kicked down to #2 by Hanson’s “MMMBop” on May 24.","March 1, 1997"
