10cc,I’m Not in Love,"I’m Not in Love Lyrics
I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because
I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

I'm not in love, no no
It's because...

I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us

I'm not in love, no no
It's because...

Be quiet, big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry

I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me

I'm not in love, no no
It's because...

Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
Ooh
I'm not in love
I'm not in love28Embed","“I’m Not in Love” is a song written by Eric Stewart and Graham Gouldman of 10cc, from their album The Original Soundtrack.

The song expresses a highly romantic feeling yet the speaker seems to be in denial. He repeats several times “I’m not in love”, but at the end of the song he realises that he is deceiving himself.

The band had wanted to write a love song without sinking themselves into the mire of cliches that came with the traditional love song – so, Eric Stewart suggested a song called “I’m Not in Love”.

The song was originally written as a bossa nova, with congos and island-sounding instruments like that. The band, however, hated that version – especially Kevin Godley. They saw the promise it had, but were stuck without ideas as to how it could be improved. Then, out of desperation, Godley said:

Well, why don’t we do it with voices, no instruments? Just all… a tsunami of voices… let’s do the whole backing track with voices, like a massive choir, the biggest choir you can imagine.

However, the band didn’t exactly have a massive, angelic choir at their disposal. So Lol Creme came up with a further idea – they’d create the choir themselves with tape loops.

So the three members – Kevin, Lol & Graham – spent three weeks in the studio crafting an artificial choir. They would hold one note for as long as they possibly could 16 times in a row (one for each track on their 16-track machine), then they’d bounce all of that down onto stereo tape. They repeated this process for 13 notes – a chromatic scale in the key of C. This ended up giving the band 624 voices to work with, in total.

The band then composed the song by playing the control board as a keyboard – each member had three faders to work with (which corresponded to three notes) and they composed the song by pushing the faders back and forth. All of the notes play at once throughout the entire song; they were prevented from being fully muted by a piece of masking tape which kept the faders from falling below a certain volume level. This is what causes the harmony to sound like an incredible, overwhelming blanket of sound – an entire chromatic scale being sung all at once by the equivalent of 624 people.

The band then recorded a rhythm track which was intended to be temporary – they were going to record over it with another acapella layer which mimicked it. However, the band liked the way it worked with the tape-choir section and kept it. So the version which was intended to be a sort of intermediary draft ended up being the final version of the song.

Godley, however, still wasn’t satisfied with the song as it was. Something effusive was still missing and he couldn’t put his finger on it. Suddenly, Lol Creme remembered something he’d said while recording the grand piano solo – “Be quiet, big boys don’t cry.” Godley loved it and wanted it in. However, Creme’s voice just wasn’t right. They needed something else. Just then, the band’s secretary, Kathy Redfern, popped her head into the studio and whispered, “Eric, sorry to bother you. There’s a telephone call for you.” Lol jumped up and cried, “That’s the voice! Her voice is perfect!” And with that addition, the song was complete.

“I’m Not in Love” was the second single released in support of the band’s third album, The Original Soundtrack. It was the band’s breakthrough hit, reaching #1 in the UK, Ireland and Canada and #2 in the US. It’s been featured in many soundtracks since then, including The Virgin Suicides, Guardians of the Galaxy and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories.","March 11, 1975"
10cc,Dreadlock Holiday,"Dreadlock Holiday Lyrics
I was walkin' down the street
Concentrating on truckin' right
I heard a dark voice beside of me
And I looked round in a state of fright
I saw four faces, one mad
A brother from the gutter
They looked me up and down a bit
And turned to each other

I say
I don't like cricket, oh no
I love it
I don't like cricket, no no
I love it
Don't you walk through my words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk through my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet

Well he looked down at my silver chain
He said I'll give you one dollar
I said you've got to be joking man
It was a present from me mother
He said I like it I want it
I'll take it off your hands
And you'll be sorry you crossed me
You'd better understand that you're alone
A long way from home
And I say
I don't like reggae, no no
I love it
I don't like reggae
I love it
Don't you cramp me style
Don't you queer me pitch
Don't you walk through my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet

I hurried back to the swimming pool
Sinkin' piña colada
I heard a dark voice beside me say
Would you like something harder?
She said I've got it, you want it
My harvest is the best
And if you try it, you'll like it
And wallow in a dreadlock holiday
(Dreadlock holiday, dreadlock holiday
Dreadlock holiday, dreadlock holiday)

And I say
Don't like Jamaica, oh no
I love her
Don't like Jamaica, oh no
I love her (Oh yeah)
Don't you walk through her words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk through her words
'Cause you ain't heard her out yet
I don't like cricket (Oh no)
I love it (Dreadlock holiday)
I don't like reggae (Oh no)
I love it (Dreadlock holiday)
Don't like Jamaica (Hey)
I love her (Dreadlock holiday)
I don't like cricket5Embed","The band have helpfully decoded this track for us:

“Dreadlock Holiday” is an interesting song because it came from 3 different sources. I had seen a white guy trying to “Truck“ down a street in Barbados, had been threatened with a knife on a raft in the middle of the ocean, and I had been asked “Have you got everything you need?” from a “Dealer“ on the beach in Barbados. Graham Gouldman had the line “I don’t like cricket, I love it” quoted to him on Jamaica, and the “Don’t you walk through my words“ came from a Radio DJ from Newcastle who was challenged when he walked through a group of black guys talking together.

Essentially, it’s an outsider trying to fit in to Jamaican culture. He pronounces “I don’t like cricket,” and, upon seeing the shock of those around him, quickly modifies it to “I love it!”

The song was a hit, reaching 44 on the US Billboard 100 and charting well in Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia, all three countries where cricket is incredibly important.",July 1978
10cc,The Things We Do for Love,"The Things We Do for Love Lyrics{Intro}

Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea
You lay your bets and then you pay the price

The things we do for love
The things we do for love

Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number
And your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down

The things we do for love
The things we do for love

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up
Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall
{Bridge}

Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up
Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall

A compromise would surely help the situation
Agree to disagree
But disagree to part
When after all it's just a compromise of

The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love
The things we do for love....5Embed","10CC was always “accused” of trying to be the ‘new Beatles"", and this song demonstrates why. The “pop and vocal harmonies” do indeed remind of late Beatles work. Made it to the top 10 in both the UK and the US.

10cc,Rubber Bullets,"Rubber Bullets Lyrics
I went to a party
At the local county jail
All the cons were dancing
And the band began to wail
But the guys were indiscreet
They were brawling in the street
At the local dance
At the local county jail

Well the band were playing
And the booze began to flow
But the sound came over
On the police car radio
Down at Precinct 49
Having a tear-gas of a time
Sergeant Baker got a call
From the governor of the county jail

Load up, load up, load up
With rubber bullets
Load up, load up, load up
With rubber bullets
I love to hear those convicts squeal
It's a shame these slugs ain't real
But we can't have dancin'
At the local county jail
Sergeant Baker and his men
Made a bee-line for the jail
And for miles around
You could hear the sirens wail
There's a rumor goin' 'round death row
That a fuse is gonna blow
At the local hop
At the local county jail
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do?

Sergeant Baker started talkin'
With a bullhorn in his hand
He was cool, he was clear
He was always in command
He said, ""Blood will flow
Here, Padre
Padre, you talk to your boys
Trust in me
God will come to set you free""

Well, we don't understand
Why you called in the National Guard
When Uncle Sam is the one
Who belongs in the exercise yard
We all got balls and brains
But some's got balls and chains
At the local dance
At the local county jail
Load up, load up, load up
With rubber bullets
Load up, load up, load up
With rubber bullets
Is it really such a crime
For a guy to spend his time
At the local dance
At the local county jail?
At the local dance
At the local county jail?
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do?3Embed","“Rubber Bullets” is 1973 song from English rock/pop band 10cc from their self-titled debut. It was written by drummer Kevin Godley, guitarist Lol Creme, and the only consistent member of the band, Graham Gouldman. It was produced by the band themselves.

The lyrics are about a group of inmates who throw a party without permission of the warden. Alcohol is brought into the picture and it’s no surprise that a riot breaks out. The police begin using rubber bullets and the situation becomes so bad that the National Guard are called in.

The song satirizes films starring the iconic 1930’s actor James Cagney. They were typically about gangsters and had macho elements.

It had limited airplay in the UK because of the problems in Northern Ireland at the time.","March 13, 1973"
10cc,"I’m Mandy, Fly Me","I’m Mandy, Fly Me Lyrics
Oh, no you'll never get me up in one of these again
'Cos what goes up (What goes up)
Must come-

Just like a rollin' stone
I'm outside lookin' in
But if your chance came would you take it?
Where on earth do I begin?

I'm Mandy, fly me

I've often heard her jingle
It's never struck a chord
With a smile as bright as sunshine
She called me through the poster
And welcomed me aboard
She led me she fed me
She read me like a book
But I'm hiding in the small print
Won't you take another look?
And take me away
Try me, Mandy, fly me away
The world was spinning like a ball
And then it wasn't there at all
And as my heart began to fall


I saw her walking on the water
As the sharks were comin' for me
I felt Mandy pull me up, give me the kiss of life
Just like the girl in Dr. No No No No
Oh, when they pulled me from the wreckage
And her body couldn't be found
Was it in my mind it seems
I had a crazy dream
I told them so but they said no no no no

I found me on a street
And starin' at a wall
If it hadn't have been for Mandy
Her promise up above me
Well I wouldn't be here at all
So if you're travellin' in the sky
Don't be surprised if someone says ""Hi...""
""I'm Mandy, fly me""Embed","Eric Stewart recalled the origins of the song “I’m Mandy Fly Me”:

National Airlines used to have this beautiful poster that they displayed of this gorgeous stewardess inviting you onto the plane. […] “I’m Cindy, fly me” which was a quite sexual connotation as well … and I thought God, do you know, there’s a song there.




So I brought it back…and put it to the guys: “Anybody interested in this ‘I’m Mandy Fly Me’?”.I’d switched it to Mandy. And Graham said “yeah, that sounds like a good idea. … We wrote it, and we didn’t like it. We, we scrapped it. It just wasn’t going anywhere.

But, enter from stage left, ha ha, the “wicked villain” Kevin Godley, twiddling his moustache, says “I know what’s wrong with it. Let’s sit down again.” He said “I think it just gets too bland, it just goes on, on one plane, your verses and your middles and your der-der-der, they’re all going on the one plane. What it needs is someone to go ‘Bash’ on the side of your head”. So we changed the rhythm completely, and we put two whacking great guitar solos in there, in the middle of this quiet, soft, floaty song. Once we’d got that idea in, it, it just gelled into something else.","January 1, 1976"
10cc,Life Is a Minestrone,"Life Is a Minestrone Lyrics
I'm dancing on the White House lawn
Sipping tea by the Taj Mahal at dawn
Hanging 'round the gardens of Babylon
Minnie Mouse has got it all sewn up (Come on, Pluto!)
She gets more fan mail than the Pope (Own up, own up)
She takes the Mickey out of all my phobias
Like signing cheques to ward off double pneumonia

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze

I'm leaning on the Tower of Pisa
Had an eyeful of the tower in France
I'm hanging 'round the gardens of Madison

Relieves a constipated mind
I'm like a gourmet in a skid row diner
A fitting menu for a dilettante

2Pac’s feud with Biggie and Bad Boy was rooted in the 1994 shooting at the Quad Recording Studios. Shakur believed that Bad Boy Records were involved in his shooting because Biggie and Puff Daddy were at the studio the same night he was robbed and shot in the studio lobby. Months after the incident, Biggie released “Who Shot Ya?” while Tupac was incarcerated for sexual abuse allegations. Shakur was aggravated by the song and saw it as an insult, as noted in a 1995 Vibe interview.

In a June 2017 interview with DJ Vlad, Outlawz rappers E.D.I. Mean and Young Noble revealed that 2Pac planned this track while he was still in prison. He began recording in May 1996 at the Cam-Am studios in Los Angeles and enlisted the help of Johnny J, who had worked on several songs on both Me Against the World and All Eyez On Me. On this track, Johnny sampled the bassline from Dennis Edwards’s 1984 song, “Don’t Look Any Further,” and ‘Pac purposefully interpolated two songs from The Notorious B.I.G.’s group, Junior M.A.F.I.A.: 1995’s “Player’s Anthem” and “Get Money.”

On June 3, 1996, Shakur recorded a music video for the song with The Outlawz. The video was filmed inside a warehouse and featured satiric impersonations of Biggie, Puffy, and Lil' Kim.

This song spawned controversy and exacerbated the East Coast–West Coast rivalry even further. Biggie never responded directly but he took jabs at ‘Pac on “Long Kiss Goodnight.” Mobb Deep retaliated with their 1996 track, “Drop A Gem On ‘Em.”

2Pac extended his beef with the East Coast on tracks such as “Bomb First (My Second Reply)” and “Against All Odds” off of his November 1996 posthumous album, The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory.","June 4, 1996"
2Pac,Changes,"Changes Lyrics
Ooh, yeah (Ooh)
(Come on, come on)

I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? Uh
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and that's the way it is
(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah-yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Come on, come on)
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other (Kill each other)
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president, uh (Oh-ooh)
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change (Never change)
Try to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game (Ooh)
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you (Yeah)
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids (Oh-oh), ""I gotta get paid"" (Oh)
Well hey, well that's the way it is
(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Aww, yeah, aww, yeah)

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh, yeah)
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you (Ooh)
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool (Oh)
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is
(Uh)
That's just the way it is (Just the way it is, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Things'll never be the same (Yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is)
Aww, yeah (Some things will never change, oh my)
(I'm tryna make a change)
(You're my brother, you're my sister, yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same (You're my brother, you're my sister)
That's just the way it is, aww, yeah
Some things'll never change343Embed","“Changes” is Pac’s timely meditation on race, class and politics.

2Pac,Keep Ya Head Up,"Keep Ya Head Up Lyrics
Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots (Oh)
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care (Oh)
And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (You don't need him)
You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up
(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night, my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy, huh
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up
(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

And, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends (Oh, yeah)
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But, huh, please, you got to keep your head up202Embed","2Pac may have been a gangsta, but he had feelings too! This is a feminist anthem from Pac, with references to pro-choice politics and what one might call “rape culture”.

In a 1995 interview with LA Times journalist Chuck Philips, Tupac said:

I think the shit that I say, no one else says. Who was writing about Black women before ‘Keep Ya Head Up?’ Now everybody got a song about Black women. Who was writing about that when I was writing about that? Who was writing about their own problems? I wasn’t talking [blah blah blah], I was talking my real problems. I was really having problems with police. I was really having problems with life and just being Black and why the hell we gotta get stepped on so much? But then I’m making it, I thought I was successful when I’m still getting stepped on. How come I got a boot-print on my back and I’m successful? I just couldn’t believe that. So instead of me just bugging out and doing a post office move and just shooting everything up and going to jail for a million years, I just said, ‘Fuck it. I’m in here rapping. Why not just rap about some shit that’s really happening?’

The music video opens with an image about being dedicated to  Latasha Harlins.

2Pac,Hail Mary,"Hail Mary Lyrics

Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body (All through your body)
The blow is like a 12-Gauge shotty (Uh) feel me!
(Come with me Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see)
And God said he should send his one begotten son
(What do we have here now Do you wanna ride or die)
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! (La la-da-la la la la la)
Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la

I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me through my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da

Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, Father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary, nigga!
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da
Come with me!

Do you wanna ride or die?

Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai Chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that motherfucker, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond
When I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, hail Mary (Hail Mary)
We won't worry, everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, hail Mary!

Makaveli the Don, solo
Killuminati, The 7 Days189Embed","“Hail Mary” is in keeping with the Baroque themes of the Makaveli album, and also features some impressive verses by Pac’s little homies, the Outlawz (which is rare)

This song is said to be recorded in July 8th 1996 in 30 minutes.

The song captures 2Pac zoning out the violence and negativity surrounding him, trying to have a convo with his Spiritual Mother.

Pac wrote his verses for this song in 15 minutes and the entire song was made in 30 minutes

This song is as chilling as it is spiritual. Tupac released “Hail Mary” when he had repeated visions of himself dying in the imminent future.

The music video represents Pac (as the buried Makaveli) rising from the dead to answer the prayers of a prison inmate who was wrongfully convicted of a friend’s crime. The prisoner’s prayers are answered in the form of karma.

2Pac,Dear Mama,"Dear Mama Lyrics
You are appreciated

When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hotplate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, lady (Dear Mama)

Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre

Arguably his most famous song, it was the first track he released after his stint in prison and decision to join Death Row. It was released on December 28, 1995 and eventually charted at #1 on Billboard’s Hot 100.

It was originally intended to be the first single for Dr. Dre’s 1996 Aftermath compilation and contained three verses from him.

To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her (Got ya)
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke (Hahaha)
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay us
I got no time for these bitches (Hell no,) 'cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me blitzed on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so (Haha)
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row (Yeah)
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and trick us (Haha)
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart are strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous, 'cause deep in they hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah (Haha,) and now you got me right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, I catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me (My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)

It was my only wish to rise above these jealous
Coward motherfuckers I despise, when it's time to ride
I was the first to hop inside (Let's go, nigga, let's go,) give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life (Yeah, nigga!)
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel (That's all you niggas got? Hahaha)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama (Dear Mama,) come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then, nigga, die for it
Let them other bustas try, at least you tried for it (Hahaha)
When it's time to die, then be a man and pick the way you leave (Yeah, nigga)
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me (My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Stay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years (I'm back, baby)
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck) Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish
My powers, so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace (Them niggas cowards)
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas (Bitch-ass niggas) on my team so indeed they wet me up (Punk niggas)
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it (Hahaha)
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it (Yeah, right)
Witness the realest, a who-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cries from all your people when they find her, must remind ya
(Thug life) My history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggas that played me and all the cowards that was down wit' it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, got you payin' attention to my ambitions
As a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me207Embed","For All Eyez On Me, 2Pac embraced a grittier thug persona than he ever did before, embedded partially due to his association with gangsta rap label, Death Row Records. ‘Pac felt reincarnated, and this opening aggressive track introduces listeners to his new self.

Daz Dillinger “put the gangsta twist” over the drums from Joeski Love’s “Pee Wee’s Dance” to create this beat, and 2Pac wasted no time getting on it since this was the first song he created for the album within hours of his release from prison.

Close friend and professional boxer Mike Tyson has used this song for entrance on multiple occasions. ‘Pac even wrote an alternative version specifically for Tyson to use—“Ambitionz Az A Fighta.”","February 13, 1996"

When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh-huh)
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty nines in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga, roll that weed up! (Roll it!)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)

Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah)

And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at yo' bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me:
""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let them hate, and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'

G-Unit195Embed","“In da Club” was the first of seven tracks 50 Cent recorded with Dr. Dre in only five days. Originally planned as a D12 song for the 8 Mile soundtrack, producer Dr Dre played the instrumental for 50 who immediately wrote the song’s lyrics within an hour and recorded the bulk of the vocals that night.

According to The Billboard Book Of Number 1 Hits, when choosing which song should be Get Rich or Die Tryin's lead single, Eminem favored “If I Can’t”. But when 50 asked Dre for his opinion, he opted for “In da Club” instead. After a coin toss, “In da Club” was chosen.

“In da Club” was loved by music critics and fans alike, propelling the song to #1 in seven countries including the US in the spring of 2003. Eventually the song was certified platinum in four countries. It is one of 50 Cent’s most recognizable and well-known songs.","January 7, 2003"
50 Cent,21 Questions,"21 Questions Lyrics
New York City
You are now rockin'
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it

I just wanna chill and twist the lah
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ‘cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (Like that)
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions and they all about us

50 Cent,Many Men (Wish Death),"Many Men (Wish Death) Lyrics
Man, we gotta go get somethin' to eat
Man, I'm hungry as a motherfucker
Ayo man, damn
What's takin' homie so long, son?
50, calm down, he coming
(*nine gunshots*)
Ahh, ohh! What the fuck?!
Ah, son, pull off, pull off

Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin' with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
‘Cause I'll come and take your life away

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king, and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, ‘cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say ""Only God can judge me,"" ‘cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when 'Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you mu'fuckas all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
""Hommo"" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
‘Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more

Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men

50 Cent,Patiently Waiting,"Patiently Waiting Lyrics
Hey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?
(Ha-ha-ha) I owe you for this one

I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from 9/11 (Yeah)
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (Uh-huh)
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)

And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

You've been patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit—spray 'em, 50
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'? You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts to this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (Woo), it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50

You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

If the gun squad hearin' all the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50—man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

You know you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house (Yeah)
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face (Uh-huh)
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you're makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper (Uh-huh)
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper (Flipper)
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey

Now, Shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her, 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid

Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P

Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit

Man, this ho, you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know

Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
'Cause I need four TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho, make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick

50 Cent,My Life,"My Life Lyrics
My, yeah, yeah, mmm
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah

Yeah, '03, I went from quite filthy to filthy rich
Man, their emotions change, so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
‘Cause I'm not writin' anymore, they not makin' hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money's evil, look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doin' what I'm supposed to
I'm a writer, I'm a fighter, entrepreneur
Fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver—what's it to ya?
The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah

While you were sippin' your own Kool-Aid gettin' your buzz heavy
I was in the fuckin' shed, sharpenin' my machete
Sippin' on some of that revenge juice, gettin' my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti or should I say this spa-get-even?
I think you fuckin' meatballs keep on just forgettin'
Thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the beginnin'
He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offendin'! (Yeah!)
He'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the
Motherfuckin' wall with 3000 volts of electricity
Now take the other end of 'em, then plug them motherfuckers-in-each
One of your eye sockets 'cause I thought you might finally fuckin' see
That'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit, fuck lettin'
Up! You’re gonna end up regrettin' you ever betted against me
Feels like I'ma snap any minute
Yeah, it's happenin' again
And I'm thinkin' about just sayin', ""Motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!""
‘Cause this is all I know
This is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul
In this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap
But every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right to this bubble
Oh I guess it's bubble wrap (Haha)
It's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm goin' psycho again (Ch, ch, ch, ch)
And I might just blow my lid
Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
‘Cause I'm runnin' in circles with—
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah

I haven't been this fuckin' confused since I was a kid
Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me, maybe
Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it 3 a.m. in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers
I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get yo' ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic
Pussy, now pick the casket
Dirt nap with the maggots, it's tragic
It's sad, it's never gonna end
Now we number one again
With that frown on your face and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it, this a gift God-given
Like the air in the lungs of every fuckin' thing livin'
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go

It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go

So seductive

I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop (Yeah)
Want one taste of what I got? (Uh-huh)
I'll have you spendin' all you got (Come on)
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa

You could have it your way, how do you want it?
You gon' back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature risin', okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm tryin' to explain, baby, the best way I can
I'll melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (Ha-ha)
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop

Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa

Girl, what we do (What we do)
And where we do (And where we do)
The things we do (Things we do)
Are just between me and you, yeah (Oh yeah)

Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Want one taste of what I got?
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa

She comes rolling right off the tip of my tongue so easy
She'll be the first damn thing I want when I start drinking
I'm breathing her in, breathing her out, once I pick her up I can't put her down

She's smoke
I pull her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke

She'll go floating around like a downtown ballroom gypsy
She goes great with ice cold beer or a shot of whiskey
Put one in my hand, her on my lips
Man, that's as good as it gets

She's smoke
I pull her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart

Watching her sway and go

I ain't perfect
No I never claimed to be
And I'm still workin' on a better side of me
Sometimes I drink too much
Sometimes I smoke and cuss
I work hard to play hard hell like everybody does

But I took the long way every lesson I learned
And I gotta scar to show for every stripe that I've earned
But looking back can't help but laugh at all the pages I've turned
No worries it's just water under the bridges I've burned

Yeah I've been real close I've even said those three words
And everybody knows when you take it back it hurts
Every little white lie, every bullshit fight
It started the fire when the flames got higher
Just stew up two and smoke the tires

But I took the long way every lesson I learned
And I gotta scar to show for every stripe that I've earned
But looking back can't help but laugh at all the pages I've turned
No worries it's just water under the bridges I've burned
But I took the long way every lesson I learned
And I gotta scar to show for every stripe that I've earned

When my road runs out
You're gonna find me with my lead foot down
Rear view mirror, ripped off the windshield
Regrets nowhere near
When my blood runs cold
And it don't matter if I'm young or old
Cause when it's all said and done
I’ll be long gone with the sun

Gonna bang that drum, gonna light it up
Every bullet in the gun
Shot across the midnight sky
Ain't leavin' one behind

Even if I crash and burn
All the way down to the embers
Leave them something to remember
Might be glory, might be flames

Stand my ground, run from nothin'

I’m gonna come on strong
Like there's no tomorrow comin' on
Enjoy the good times while you've got 'em

I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you

Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

The song’s name is derived from Italian, where it is an interjection used in situations of surprise, anguish, or excitement (literally, “My mother”).

ABBA’s manager Stig Anderson would often come up with titles that musicians Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson would write lyrics around, and this is an example of that workflow.

It would later be the title song of the all-ABBA musical Mamma Mia with Merryl Streep and others.",September 1975

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Digging the dancing queen46Embed","When “Dancing Queen” was released, ABBA essentially made the world’s first Europop disco hit. The song was inspired by George McCrae’s 1974 disco hit “Rock Your Baby,” and Dr. John’s 1972 album, Dr. John’s Gumbo (specifically the drums).

Originally titled “Boogaloo,” the song was brought by Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to Glen Studios in Stockholm, along with “Fernando,” another famed ABBA song. In this studio was where the then-new composition eventually became what it is now.

It was reported that when Andersson first played for bandmate Frida Lyngstad the backing track for this song, she began to cry,

And that was before me and Agnetha had even sung on it! I knew it was absolutely the best song ABBA had ever done.

Lead vocalist Agnetha Faltskog added,

It’s often difficult to know what will be a hit. The exception was “Dancing Queen.” We all knew it was going to be massive.

“Dancing Queen” became ABBA’s only #1 song in the US. But it also ranked high up in the charts in many other countries, from Australia to Brazil to Zimbabwe. Rolling Stone ranked “Dancing Queen” at #174 on their list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.","August 15, 1976"
ABBA,The Winner Takes It All,"The Winner Takes It All Lyrics
I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)
But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence
But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

(So the winner)
(Takes it all)
(And the loser)

Half-past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight

ABBA,Super Trouper,"Super Trouper Lyrics
Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you

I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)

So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely?
Part of a success that never ends
Still, I'm thinking about you only
(Still, I'm thinking about you only)

There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be all right
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

At first called “Blinka lilla stjärna” (Swedish version of popular nursery rhyme ‘Twinkle Twinkle Little Star’, this hit single was the title track from ABBA’s 1980 studio album Super Trouper. The song was written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus with lead vocals from Anni-Frid Lyngstad.





“Super Trouper” is a part of the ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits compilation, as well as in the Mamma Mia! musical.

Super Troupers are huge spotlights used in stadium concerts and events. As popular ABBA was, the foursome were not really fond of performing onstage and liked performing in studios rather than going on tour. The idea is reflected in this song, which has an upbeat tempo while the lyrics take a more lonely approach to stardom.

“Super Trouper” topped the charts in West Germany, Great Britain, Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands. It was among the top 5 in Austria, France, Norway, and Switzerland, while it remained in Top 10 in Finland and Spain. It remains one of the most played songs of ABBA on YouTube.","November 3, 1980"
ABBA,Fernando,"Fernando Lyrics

Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret

I would, my friend, Fernando

I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando10Embed","Originally released as an Anni-Frid Lyngstad solo song in 1975, ABBA re-released this song in 1976 and eventually turned this into one of the best-selling songs of all time.

It was written by Benny Andersson, Bjorn Ulvaeus, Stig Anderson. Ulvaeus recalled writing the song in the book 1000 UK #1 Hits:

That lyric is so banal and I didn’t like it. It was a love lyric, someone who loved Fernando, but I inherited the word ‘Fernando’ and I thought long and hard, what does Fernando tell me? I was in my summerhouse one starry evening and the words came, ‘There was something in the air that night’ and I thought of two old comrades from some guerrilla war in Mexico who would be sitting in the porch and reminiscing about what happened to them back then and this is what it is all about. Total fiction.

It had a modest start in Sweden (in Swedish) before the English mega-hit version showed up. It spent 15 (!!) weeks at the top of the charts in Australia. The song was never a part of a studio album, but appeared in compilations.","April 12, 1976"

You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now, I see you've broken a feather
(How it hurts to see you cry)
(And how it hurts to see you sad)
I hope we can patch it up together

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again
And the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)

Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)
Like you did before
(The way you used to do before)
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

And your love's a blown-out candle
All is gone, and it seems too hard to handle

Would you know just what to do or where to keep it?

ABC,All of My Heart,"All of My Heart Lyrics
Once upon a time when we were friends
I gave you my heart, the story ends
No happy ever after, now were friends
Wish upon a star if that might help
The stars collide if you decide
Wish upon a star if that might help

What's it like to have loved and to lose her touch?
What's it like to have loved and to lose that much?
Well I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll walk in the room with my heart
Add and subtract but as a matter of fact
Now that you're gone I still want you back
Remembering, surrendering
Remembering that part
All of my heart

Spilling up pink silk and coffee lace
You hook me up, I rendezvous at your place
Your lipstick and your lip gloss seals my fate
Sentimental powers might help you now
But skip the hearts and flowers, skip the ivory towers
You'll be disappointed and I'll lose a friend
No I won't be told there's a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow
Or that pleasure and pain, sunshine and rain
Might make this love grow

But I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll walk in the room with my heart
Add and subtract but as a matter of fact
Now that you're gone I still want you back
Remembering, surrendering
The kindest cut's the cruelest part
All of my heart

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ohh, ooh, ooh

Yes I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll walk in the room with my heart
And I shrug and I say that maybe today
You'll come home soon

It was released as a single in August of 1982, and became a top 5 hit in the UK



The song portrays the bitter, desperate, mixed emotions of a man attempting to stay “just friends” with a woman who broke his heart.

Lead singer Martin Fry gives a masterful vocal performance, ranging from tightly controlled, almost emotionless vocals to “over the top” pleading.

Pichfork music reviewer Jess Harvell declared “All of My Heart” to be the greatest song of the UK post-punk “New Pop” era.","August 27, 1982"

In deep despair on lonely nights

In miracles made real

You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight

When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings

But the back door it rings
And Smokey sings, he sings

Elegance in eloquence
For sale or rent or hire
Should I say yes and match his best
Then I would be a liar
Symphonies that soothe the rage
When lovers' hearts catch fire
Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight

With the heaven she brings

U2 was originally asked to perform this song for the movie—the idea for Aerosmith performing it only came after Liv was cast.

Aerosmith’s guitarist Joe Perry explained to Classic Rock magazine in 2002:

At the time, we just didn’t have the time to settle down and do it. We were out on the road, so they brought us in to see the movie and said ‘here’s the song, this is where it fits into the movie, you can do it if you want.’ So we were in the studio within the next three days cutting it. And yeah, we do wish that we’d had a little more time, so that we could have had a shot at writing it, but it was perfect timing. The song was great, people loved it, and I don’t think people care that much who wrote it.

Spinner claims that songwriter Diane Warren intended the song to be for Celine Dion.","August 18, 1998"

Frontman Steven Tyler began writing the song on his father’s Estey upright organ as a teen and finished it on a piano in the basement where the band lived in the early 1970s. He claims the ‘chordage’ of the song came from laying under his father’s piano as a child and listening to him play.

On its original 1973 release, “Dream On” charted at #59 (though regionally in New England it was more successful).  But after the top 40 success of “Sweet Emotion” from their 3rd album in 1975, the re-release of “Dream On” sent the song all the way to #6 the following year. It remained their biggest hit until “Angel” reached #3 twelve years later.

“Dream On” is a bittersweet take on aging, and how one should continue to live one’s life to the fullest as time is a commodity that we don’t have control over and the “good Lord” is able to take us away at any time.

In 2003, Eminem interpolated “Dream On” into his song “Sing For The Moment”. Joe Perry played the guitar solo towards the end of Em’s song.","June 27, 1973"

It became the band’s second Top 40 hit from the album, peaking at the No. 12 position on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping its Mainstream Album Rock chart.

The music video features Alicia Silverstone, who plays a rebellious ex girlfriend. Out of the frustration caused by her ex, she gets a navel piercing (and goes bungee-jumping with the rope attached to it). This is now credited as the reason for the certain piercing’s sudden popularity.



The video, directed by Marty Callner, features the first of three appearances by Alicia Silverstone in the band’s videos, the next two being “Amazing” (1993) and “Crazy” (1994) also directed by Callner.","June 20, 1993"
Aerosmith,Walk This Way,"Walk This Way Lyrics

Backstroking lover, always hiding 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to my daddy, he say
He said, ""You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changing your ways.""
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of loving with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss, like this


See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing ""Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care.""
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

""Walk this way, talk this way""
""Walk this way, walk this way""
""Walk this way, walk this way""
""Walk this way, talk this way""
Ah, just give me a kiss
Like this

Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbing way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was looking at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this


See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing ""Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care.""
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

""Walk this way, talk this way""
""Walk this way, walk this way""
""Walk this way, walk this way""
""Walk this way, talk this way""
Just give me a kiss

It did not originally chart, but after “Dream On” from the band’s debut album was reissued and climbed to #6 in 1976, “Walk This Way” was also reissued and reached #10 in early 1977.

The band got the idea for the song’s lyrics from a line in the film Young Frankenstein that originally came from The Three Stooges. While the lyrics sound dirty on the surface, the less obvious meaning trumps it. The title of the song derives from the idea that his fingers are moving in a walking motion while he is sexually pleasing her.

In 1986, producer Rick Rubin arranged for Run DMC to do a cover of the song involving both Tyler and Perry. While both acts were initially hesitant and uninterested, the song became a surprise top 10 hit in the US and the UK, and revived Aerosmith’s career which, at the time, was a low point.","August 28, 1975"

Talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing other things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I got to make clear
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year


Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go, musta got up and went
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar
'Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire

I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me because the rabbit done died, yes it did

You stand in the front just a shaking your ass
I'll take you backstage you can drink from my glass
I'll talk about something you're sure to understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eating from your hand

It was also a moderate hit in the UK, reaching #45.

According to a September 2013 Huffington Post article, it was written about a time the band walked into a bar and mistook Mötley Crüe lead singer Vince Neil for a female. When the band presented it to Desmond Child, a songwriter who had been asked to assist the band, the piece was titled “Cruisin' For The Ladies.” Child encouraged frontman Steven Tyler to go back to using his original lyric—“That dude looks like a lady”—and to write about “the whole scenario of a guy that walks into a strip joint and falls in love with the stripper on stage, goes backstage and finds out it’s a guy.”","August 31, 1987"

The song charted at Svensktoppen for weeks between 12 April and 19 July 1970, peaking at third position.

 Recording took place in January 1970 in Metronome Studios, Stockholm.

The song can be regarded as one of her most successful numbers in Sweden before the ABBA period and it was also a highlight in the set of her folk park tour in the summer of 1970. This was in spite of a claim from a Danish composer that she had used 22 bars from his composition Tema, even though this had been written in the 1950s and had never been recorded. The case dragged on until 1977, when a settlement was reached and Fältskog paid the Dane SEK 5,000.",March 1970

The older I get
The more I think
You only get a minute, better live while you’re in it
'Cause it’s gone in a blink
And the older I get
The truer it is
It’s the people you love, not the money and stuff
That makes you rich

And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet

The older I get
The fewer friends I have
But you don’t need a lot when the ones that you got
Have always got your back
And the older I get
The better I am
At knowing when to give
And when to just not give a damn

And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet
The older I get

And I don’t mind all the lines
From all the times I’ve laughed and cried
Souvenirs and little signs of the life I’ve lived

The older I get
The longer I pray
I don’t know why, I guess that I've
Got more to say

“Jim McBride and I were trying to write an up-tempo song and Jim came in with the line ‘way down yonder on the Chattahoochee’. It kind of went from there. It’s a song about having fun, growing up, and coming of age in a small town – which really applies to anyone across the country, not just by the Chattahoochee.

And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I

And walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt
Remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
Remember when

Remember when the sound of little feet
Was the music
We danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Remember when
Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now lookn' back it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are
Where we've been
Said we'd do it all again

When the children grow up and move away

Alan Jackson,Drive (For Daddy Gene),"Drive (For Daddy Gene) Lyrics
It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal
It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right""
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric chokeEmbed",?,"January 15, 2002"
Alan Jackson,Good Time,"Good Time Lyrics
Work, work all week long
Punching that clock from dusk till dawn
Counting the days till Friday night
That's when all the conditions are right
For a good time
I need a good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

I cashed my check, cleaned my truck
Put on my hat, forgot about work
Sun going down, head across town
Pick up my baby and turn it around
Good time
Ahh, I need a good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
Pig in the ground, beer on ice
Just like ole Hank taught us about
Singing along, Bocephus songs
Rowdy friends, all night long
Good time
Lord, we're having a good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
Whew!

Heel toe, do-si-do
Scooting our boots, swinging doors
B & D, Kix and Dunn
Honking tonk heaven, Double shotgun
Good time
Lord, we're having a good time
Cause

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
Shot of Tequila, beer on tap
Sweet southern woman set on my lap
G with an O, O with a D
T with an I and an M and an E
And a good time
Shhheww, good time

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

Ahh, turn it up now!
A shot of Tequila
Beer on tap
A good looking woman
To set on my lap
A G with an O, an O with a D
A T with an I an M with an E
That spells good time
A good time
Ohh
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time

Twelve o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock four
Five o'clock we know we're that's going to go
Closing the door, shutting them down
Head for that Waffle House way across town
Good time?
Ohh, we're having a good time
Ohh

I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
I've been working all week

Alan Jackson,Where I Come From,"Where I Come From Lyrics
Well I was rolling wheels and shifting gears
Around that Jersey Turnpike
Barney stopped me with his gun
Ten minutes after midnight
Said, ""Sir you broke the limit
In thit rusty old truck""
I don't know about that accent son
Just where did you come from

I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

Well I was south of Detroit City
I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue
The sign said finger-lickin'
Well I paid the tab
And the lady asked me
How'd I like my biscuit
I'll be honest with you ma'am
It ain't like mama fixed it
Cause where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from
Trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

I was chasing sun on 101
Somewhere around Ventura
I lost a universal joint
And I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked
If I had plans for dinner
Said no thanks ma'am
Back home We like the girls
That sing soprano

I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Well I was headed home on 65
Somewhere around Kentucky
The CB rang for the bobtail rig
That's rolling on like thunder
Well I answered him and he asked me
Aren't you from out in Tulsa
No, but you might have seen me there
I just dropped a load of salsa

I said where I come from
It's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of front porch sitting
Where I come from trying to make a living
And working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from

Where I come from it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from a lot of back porch picking
Where I come from trying to make a living
Working hard to get to heaven
Where I come from
Yeah where I come from
A lot of front porch sitting
Staring up at heaven

Been my only friend

Ever since I was ten

Alice Cooper,Poison,"Poison Lyrics

Your cruel device, your blood like ice
One look could kill
My pain, your thrill

I wanna love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains

Your mouth, so hot, your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet, black lace on sweat

I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (and pins)
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't wanna touch you but you're under my skin (deep in)
I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains
Poison

One look (one look) could kill (could kill)
My pain, your thrill

I want to love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison

I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison

Yeah!
Well, I don't want to break these chains
Poison (poison) no
Running deep inside my veins
Burning deep (poison) inside my brain
Poison (poison)
I don't want (poison) to break these chains
Poison (poison)14Embed","Poison compares a drug that the main protagonist of the story is addicted to with a beautiful, cruel woman; the song is part of the grand tradition of rock n' roll drug songs masquerading as a love song – songs that include ‘Beetlebum’, Got to Get You Into My Life’ and ‘Another Girl, Another Planet.‘
Cooper drops various subtle and not-very-subtle hints to heroin through the song, including referencing killing his pain, mentioning “your blood like ice” (a feeling like when the smack begins to flow), and “needles and pins” (notice how he subverts the expected 'pins and needles’?); his junk addiction is a love-hate relationship. It’s poison, and he knows it is, but he loves it, he wants to quit, but he’s chained to it.
Whether Cooper had any first-hand experience of heroin at the time he wrote the song is open to debate. Since the mid-80s, Cooper has worked to help fellow rock musicians overcome their addictions.

The song tied “School’s Out” for Cooper’s highest US chart placing at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100.
This was Cooper’s first music video to get rotation on MTV tapping him into the MTV audience for the first time. There are two versions of the video since the first was censored due to a topless Rana Kennedy. The second version has the model’s breasts covered with a corset.

He became far more relevant to the younger generation, who got the joke when he showed up in the movie Wayne’s World in 1992.

I see it every day
See my lonely mind explode

Blown up in my face


I grabbed my hat and I got my coat
And I, I ran into the street
I saw a man that was choking there
I guess he couldn't breathe
Said to myself this is very strange
I'm glad it wasn't me
But now I hear those sirens callin'
And so I am not free

The titular ‘Dwight Fry’ is a tribute of sorts to the actor Dwight Frye. Frye’s most memorable role is that of Renfield in the Universal Studios' film, Dracula.  Frye died in 1943 at the age of 44 from a heart attack.","March 8, 1971"

The background falsetto is provided by Scottish singer/songwriter, Donovan.

In spite of the oftentimes comically distorted and grotesque subject matter throughout the album, Cooper says that Chuck Berry provided the bulk of his inspiration while making the album:

Berry was my favorite lyricist…“When I first heard something like “Nadine,” or “Maybelline,” I understood those songs told a story. As the lyrics went along, you really got a picture of what was going on. He took the girl out; he couldn’t get his seat belt off – things like that. I always wanted to write three-minute stories that were funny, or maybe not just funny, but also dramatic. The idea was to compact everything into three minutes, which is really hard to do.","February 25, 1973"

Dick Wagner, who co-wrote the song with Cooper, said of the lyrics:

It’s really a song about domestic violence. It was misunderstood when it first came out. It was supposedly about a woman’s period, but it wasn’t. It was about a woman’s subservient position in society to a man. I’m a firm believer that women are the superior sex. ‘Only Women Bleed’ was a liberating kind of song.",April 1975

Good Lord show me the way8Embed","“Down to the River to Pray” is a traditional American Christian folk hymn. It dates to the mid-19th century as a Negro Spiritual, “The Good Old Way”.

There are many versions of the song, and this one became popular when it appeared in the sound-track of the movie, O Brother, Where Art Thou?.

In the film of O Brother, Where Art Thou the hymn is sung as people wade into a river to be baptised (dunked in the water) by a preacher.","December 5, 2000"

Don't sigh a sigh for me
Don't ever cry for me
This is goodbye from me
I know we're through
I'm losing you

Love sang its song for me
Then things went wrong for me
Nights are too long for me
Because I'm losing you

Our love and our devotion
Were deep as any ocean
Then one day, like the tide
You began to change
And you became a perfect stranger

Someone is holding you
Sharing the lips I knew
I can't believe it's true
That I am losing you
I can't believe it's true
That I am losing… you…Embed",?,"January 6, 2017"

It's good to see you again
Come and sit for a while

I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell
Tomorrow, you'll be thinking to yourself
""Yeah, where did it all go wrong?""
But the list goes on and on

And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell

Now, you'll never see what you've done to me
You can take back your memories, they're no good to me
And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look that you wear so well
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well

Your subtleties, they strangle me
I can't explain myself at all
And all the wants and all the needs
All I don't want to need at all

Maybe it's best you leave me alone
A weight is lifted on this evening
I give the final blow

When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, it ends tonight

A falling star, at least I fall alone
I can't explain what you can explain
You're finding things that you didn't know
I look at you with such disdain

The walls start breathing, my mind's unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone
A weight is lifted on this evening
I give the final blow
When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, it ends tonight
Just a little insight won't make this right
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight
It ends tonight

Now I'm on my own side
It's better than being on your side
It's my fault when you're blind
It's better that I see it through your eyes
All these thoughts locked inside
Now you're the first to know

At first listen, this song might sound like it was influenced by a bad breakup. Although it could be interpreted as such, this song was inspired a “dude” who drove lead singer Tyson Ritter crazy – one of his guitar tech buddies while on tour.

He was significantly older than us at the time, and he acts like an old man: going to bed early, really being a bum around Ty. Because Ty’s a night owl. He wanted to stay up, he wanted to hang out. […] He [got] frustrated and fed up with this guy bringing things down, and we wrote this song.

Interestingly, guitarist Nick Wheeler said the band was pushed to their wit’s end and was told to keep writing to get their second album Move Along to a higher standard… and it paid off. “It Ends Tonight” was one of the last songs they wrote, and it cracked the top 10 of the Billboard charts.

While Duane was around, we were a blues-based band that added John Coltrane and Miles Davis to the mix. After Duane died, we started heading in a country direction because that was Dickey’s background. We all thought ‘Ramblin’ Man’ was too country to even record. We knew it was a good song but it didn’t sound like us. We went to the studio to do a demo to send to Merle Haggard or someone and then we got into that big long guitar jam, which kind of fit us, so we put it on the album and it became a hit. Then it more and more became Dickey’s band.

“Ramblin' Man”, along with “Wasted Words”, would be bassist Berry Oakley’s last recordings with the band before his tragic death in a motorcycle accident.","August 1, 1973"

Or will his spirit float away?

The song was written by vocalist Gregg Allman long before the founding of the group. It was first written in 1967, and two demo versions from those years exists, including a version cut by the 31st of February, a band that featured Butch Trucks, the Allman Brothers' later drummer. Allman sold the publishing rights later that year, but they were reacquired by manager Phil Walden in 1972.

The song’s title is frequently referred to incorrectly as “Sweet Melissa” due to the lyric being sung at the end of each of the first two choruses.

The version on Eat a Peach was recorded in tribute to Duane Allman, who considered the song among his brother’s best and a personal favorite.","February 12, 1972"

The Allman Brothers Band,Soulshine,"Soulshine Lyrics
When you can't find the light
That guides you through a cloudy day
When the stars ain't shining bright
You feel like you've lost you're way
When the candle light of home
Burns so very far away
Well, you got to let your soul shine
Just like my daddy used to say

He used to say soulshine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Hey now people, don't mind
We all get this way sometime
Got to let your soul shine, shine till the break of day

I grew up thinking that I had it made
Gonna make it on my own
Life can take the strongest man
Make him feel so alone
Now sometimes I feel a cold wind
Blowing through my aching bones
I think back to what my daddy said
He said, ""Boy, there is darkness before the dawn""
Let your soul shine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Yeah, now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day

Sometimes a man can feel this emptiness
Like a woman has robbed him of his very soul
A woman too, God knows, she can feel like this
And when your world seems cold
You got to let your spirit take control

Talking 'bout soulshine
It's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Lord now people don't mind
We all get this way sometimes
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day
Oh, it's better than sunshine
It's better than moonshine
Damn sure better than rain
Yeah, now people don't mind
We all feel this way sometimes
Gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day1Embed","This an inspirational song for many; explaining that it’s not what you encounter that matters, but what’s inside of you that makes it a better day.

The songwriter, Warren Haynes said this about the song:

The song isn’t really about my dad but references him and our strong relationship. He is a huge part of my life, a huge inspiration and a great role model. It’s great to be able to have the opportunity to express that.""

Amy Winehouse,Back to Black,"Back to Black Lyrics
He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet with his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry, get on without my guy
You went back to what you know
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked, I'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
I go back to us

I love you much, it's not enough
You love blow and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rollin' up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
Black, black, black, black
Black, black, black
I go back to
I go back to

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back to black106Embed","Ranked as the #98 best song of the 2000’s, “Back to Black” details the harsh reality Winehouse faced after her then-boyfriend, Blake Fielder-Civil, ended their relationship to return to his ex-girlfriend.

The titular “black” to which Winehouse goes back refers to the dark moments of depression and the reliance on alcohol to cope with her heartache. Winehouse commented on the depressing period of time during a 2007 interview with CNN, saying:

I was drinking a lot – not anything terrible, I was just tryna forget about the fact that I had finished this relationship.

The song was released as the third single from the 2006 album of the same name, and, as of July 2015, has sold over 350,000 copies in the United Kingdom alone.

The song was written in March 2006 in New York alongside British songwriter and producer Mark Ronson, who also helped to craft five more songs on the album. During an interview with Red Bull Music Academy in April 2015, Ronson expanded on the creation of the song:

 The song – it took me about one night to lay the foundation of that track and then Amy wrote the lyrics and the melody especially fast, so it was like half a day, and then we probably recorded the rhythm track in three hours.","April 30, 2007"
Amy Winehouse,You Know I’m No Good,"You Know I’m No Good Lyrics
Meet you downstairs, in the bar and hurt
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say ""What did you do with him today?""
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in a place but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet you, chips and pita
You say, ""When we married""
'Cause you're not bitter
""There'll be none of him no more""
I cried for you on the kitchen floor
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soap my feet
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drop and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
Who truly stuck the knife in first?

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yeah, you know that I'm no good62Embed","In the quintessential Winehouse track “You Know I’m No Good,” Amy uses her drug and alcohol use to justify her infidelity in a relationship. The track is quite telling of Amy’s dark and dangerous lifestyle of heavy drinking and addiction, with her extensive drinking habits ultimately leading to her demise in 2011.

Throughout the track, Amy paints a telling picture of her tempestuous relationship with her man. Even though she exhibits warning signs of her bad behaviour and precarious lifestyle of substance abuse and cheating, her man still takes her back and looks past all her damaging actions.

The song was the second single from 2006’s Back to Black and was released alongside the B-side track “Monkey Man.”","January 8, 2007"
Amy Winehouse,Rehab,"Rehab Lyrics
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, ""No, no, no""
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go

I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway

I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, ""No, no, no""
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know

I said, ""I got no idea""
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said, ""I just think you're depressed""
This, me: ""Yeah, baby, and the rest""

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, ""No, no, no""
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know

I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

It's not just my pride
It's just till these tears have dried
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, ""No, no, no""
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go52Embed","“Rehab,” the leading single off of Back To Black, arguably put Winehouse on the international map. The song is a hauntingly ironic, upbeat tune where Winehouse refuses to go to a rehabilitation centre to help manage her drug and alcohol problem.

Despite her resistance against any form of professional rehabilitation, she ended up checking into a rehab centre in early 2008, leaving just in time for the 50th Grammy Awards where she would take home a Grammy for Song Of The Year, Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Record Of The Year, each for “Rehab.”



 Winehouse’s infamous reaction to winning Record Of The Year

While the song brought her much success, its message was questioned by listeners who were concerned for Winehouse’s health and addiction problems in real life. Almost four years after her tragic death, Winehouse’s former manager sat down with The Guardian in June 2015 and revealed how “Rehab,” specifically, had left a mark on him and those close to Winehouse, saying:

I knew at some point she’d write a really big hit, and it was ironic that the hit she wrote was, verbatim, that day, and it was mocking me. Not only was I not her manager any more, but she’d written this huge hit that’s undeniably brilliant, that was a complete mockery of our friendship and of what she needed. And the whole world’s dancing along to it, and really she was writing about a decision that five years later would result in her being dead. It was really fucked up. […] I can’t really listen to Amy any more, unfortunately. If I walk into a shop and she’s playing, I always get a little sense of pride and warmth, but I can’t put it on.","October 23, 2006"
Amy Winehouse,Tears Dry on Their Own,"Tears Dry on Their Own Lyrics

All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right, when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, my blue shade
My tears dry on their own
Woah, he walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry on their own, woah
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry39Embed","Written in Miami with producer Salaam Remi, “Tears Dry On Their Own” has grown to become one of the most recognisable songs in Winehouse’s discography. During an undated interview with BBC, Winehouse described the song as:

I was with someone that I couldn’t really be with and I knew it wouldn’t last. But I think because I knew it couldn’t last, it’s kinda like saying, “I’m upset, but I know I’ll get over it, I guess.”

The track also samples Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell’s 1967 “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough.” While the song was originally a much slower tempo, Remi was able to picture the song having a more upbeat, “Motown” tempo after hearing the original instrumentals to “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough.”

Remi also revealed during the 2015 BBC Amy Winehouse: Back to Black documentary that one of the hardest moments of creating music with Winehouse was trying to record the upbeat vocals with the new sample. He added:

There was a lot of mad at the world, [with Amy] goin' on like, “You sing it yourself!” This just didn’t happen – these were rarities, as far as Amy needing to do a vocal over and over. Basically, frustration for the first time and the only time in our creative process was the frustration with the vocals. But, when it finally got right, it made all the difference in the world.","October 27, 2006"

Me and, oh24Embed","“Me and Mr. Jones” rotates around Winehouse’s relationship with Nasir Jones, best known by his stage name, Nas. Winehouse once revealed that this song was one of her favourites to perform live.

The two performers first crossed paths in the early 2000s thanks to their mutual producer Salaam Remi, who has produced a majority of Winehouse’s records. Remi sat down with The Hollywood Reporter in 2012 and recalled the moment he introduced the two and sparked an instant connection:

When I’d just met Amy, I was doing “Made You Look” for Nas' God’s Son album at the time. And I was just starting to work on Amy’s Frank album, so there are Nas songs where Amy did ad-libs on them that we never put out that were just background that she was just singing on. She was really inspired by him. Over the last couple years, a lot of times if I had my computer on in the studio, my Skype would ring and Amy would be there […] and then she’d end up talking to Nas or whatever, then they got each other numbers and they would talk.

In October 2011, three months after Winehouse’s death, Nas opened up about the song with XXL Magazine, confirming that he is in fact the titular Mr. Jones:

I don’t really remember if Salaam, who was really close to her, who introduced us, if he told me about it or not. I don’t remember right now. But, I heard a lot about it before I even heard the song.""

Amy Winehouse,Love Is a Losing Game,"Love Is a Losing Game Lyrics
For you, I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is a losing game
One I wish I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self-professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Though you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game25Embed","In the haunting ballad “Love Is a Losing Game,” Winehouse reflects over her painful moments of loneliness and confusion, as well as her inability to rewrite history and change how her relationship ended. Despite the song’s raw reflection on her love, she prefaced a 2006 live performance of the song by saying:

This is my favourite song from the new album. I always get a little teary when I play it.

Following her sudden split with Blake Fielder-Civil, Winehouse took a vacation to Spain with her family and purchased a guitar from a local vendor, which is what sparked the writing of “Love Is a Losing Game.”

The whole song, comprised of three verses that each contain slightly varying quatrains, is an extended metaphor, with allusions to love being some sort of unfair game closing each verse.

While Winehouse has often been considered one of the best songwriters of her time, “Love Is a Losing Game” specifically has garnered attention for its simplistic, yet powerfully deep lyrics. In 2008, two years after the song’s release, the University of Cambridge included the second and third verses on a practical criticism exam for their English students.

In celebration of the 13 year anniversary of the song’s release as the fifth and final single off Back to Black, the Amy Winehouse Foundation released an official animated lyric video on December 10, 2020.","December 5, 2007"

Part II: ""Stronger Than Me""

Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always wanna talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady and you my ladyboy

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do, are you gay?

Thought you had so many lessons to learn""

Sound as if you're reading from some other tired script""
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

The two dated on and off before Winehouse came to the decision that Taylor simply wasn’t man enough for her, and that the roles in the relationship had quickly reversed.

The song stirred up some controversy due to its objectification of gender roles, with Winehouse insisting that her partner act manlier and tougher.

This version of the track includes a scatting intro to open the album, though the single edit of “Stronger Than Me” omits the introduction.","October 6, 2003"

Ognuno dia la mano al suo vicino
Simbolo di pace, di fraternità
La forza che ci da
We ask that life be kind
E il desiderio che
And watch us from above
Ognuno trovi amor
We hope each soul will find
Intorno e dentro se
Another soul to love

Let this be our prayer
Let this be our prayer, just like every child
Just like every child
Need to find a place, guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe

Hai acceso in noi
Sento che ci salverà5Embed",?,"March 1, 1999"

I thought sooner or later
The lights up above
Will come down in circles and guide me to love
But I don't know what's right for me
I cannot see straight
I've been here too long and I don't wanna wait for it
Fly like a cannonball
Straight to my soul
Tear me to pieces and make me feel whole
I'm willing to fight for it and carry this weight
But with every step
I keep questioning what is true

Fall on me
With open arms
Fall on me
From where you are
Fall on me
With all your light
With all your light
With all your light

Soon you will find what your heart wants to know
Don't give up hope for I know you are close
And all you have ever dreamed, wished you could ever be
Is waiting to find you wherever you go
Believe in yourself, every step that you take
Know I am smiling with pride everyday
My love will forever be, stronger than stone
Don't be afraid you are never alone
Fall on me
With open arms
Fall on me
From where you are
Fall on me
With all your light
With all your light
With all your light
With all your light

I close my eyes and I'm seeing you everywhere
I step outside
It's like I'm breathing you in the air

E più ti penso, e più mi manchi
Ti vedo coi miei occhi stanchi
Anch'io vorrei, star lì con te
Stringo il cuscino, sei qui vicino

E notte fonda e sei lontano
Ho il vuoto intorno senza te
Il sole più non c’è, no
Sono triste e sconsolato
Come non son stato mai
Senza te
Senza te

E se per caso non potessi rivederti
Io so già che farei, non vivrei

E più ti penso, e più mi manchi
Son poca cosa senza te
Mi sento un pesce che
Non ha l'acqua per nuotare
Respirare senza te

Keep it close, treasure it like the sunset
Like something more than gold

Did we almost have it all
Before we let go

Andrea Bocelli,Vivo per lei,"Vivo per lei Lyrics
Vivo per lei da quando sai
La prima volta l'ho incontrata
Non mi ricordo come, ma
Mi entrata dentro e c'è restata
Vivo per lei perché mi fa
Vibrare forte l'anima
Vivo per lei e non è un peso

Vivo per lei anch'io lo sai
E tu non esserne geloso
Lei è di tutti quelli che
Hanno un bisogno sempre acceso
Come uno stereo in camera
Di chi è da solo e adesso sa
Che anche per lui, per questo
Io vivo per lei

È una musa che ci invita
A sfiorarla con le dita
Attraverso un pianoforte
La morte lontana
Io vivo per lei
Vivo per lei che spesso sa
Essere dolce e sensuale
A volte picchia in testa, ma
È un pugno che non fa mai male

Vivo per lei, lo so mi fa
Girare di città in città
Soffrire un po', ma almeno io vivo

È un dolore quando parte
Vivo per lei dentro gli hotels
Con piacere estremo cresce
Vivo per lei nel vortice
Attraverso la mia voce
Si espande e amore produce

Vivo per lei nient'altro ho
E quanti altri incontrerò
Che come me hanno scritto in viso
Io vivo per lei
Io vivo per lei
Sopra un palco o contro un muro
Vivo per lei al limite
Anche in un domani duro
Vivo per lei al margine
Ogni giorno una conquista
La protagonista
Sarà sempre lei

Vivo per lei perché oramai
Io non ho altra via d'uscita
Perché la musica, lo sai
Davvero non l'ho mai tradita

Vivo per lei perché mi dà
Pause e note in libertà
Ci fosse un'altra vita la vivo
La vivo per lei

Vivo per lei la musica
Io vivo per lei
Vivo per lei, è unica
Io vivo per lei

And we kept it growing

We're always gonna go for more

I was able to get bloody noses very easily when I was younger, so I wanted to give myself a bloody nose, and then take a picture of it. But my nose didn’t bleed enough after I hit myself with the brick. I had to use this follow-up plan, which was [to take] this little water bottle full of pig’s blood that I’d gotten from the butcher shop. I just ended up using that because there was not enough blood from my nose after I hit myself. So, it turned out good. We took a few pictures and that one just seemed real cool, and that was it. There’s no message, other than what you see.”","November 13, 2001"

When it comes to someone else's fight
No one ever gets involved
Apathy can never solve

Forced out, brave and mighty
Stolen land, they can't fight it
Hold on to pride and tradition
Even though they know
How much their lives are really missing
We're dissing them
On reservations
A hopeless situation

Respect is something that you earn
Our Indian brothers' getting burned
Original American
Turned into a second class citizen

Forced out, brave and mighty
Stolen land, they can't fight it
Hold on to pride and tradition
Even though they know
How much their lives are really missing

Die for the Indians

Love the land and fellow man
Peace is what we strive to have
Some folks have none of this

Forced out, brave and mighty
Stolen land, they can't fight it
Hold on to pride and tradition

Cry for the Indians
Die for the Indians
Cry for the Indians
Cry, cry, cry for the Indians

The people that inhabit it make its configuration
Prejudice, something we all can do without
Flag of many colors is what this land's all about

No one ever gets involved, no one

Forced out, brave and mighty

That is true, my mum is part Native American, from the Canadian side of it (Iroquois), but I never talk to my mum about it. The rest of me is Italian American. I think it is really neat to be honest.

When I first got in the band. Charlie [Benante] used to call me Indian Joe. He was just fucking around with me, you know. And then, Scott figured we should write a song about it, you know, it’s something to bring attention too, and it’d be cool to write about, plus it would give us something to wear on stage.

Won't learn their lesson, white fills my eyes
And only then they see the light

Four walls surround me, an empty gaze

Anthrax,Among the Living,"Among the Living Lyrics

Disease, disease
Spreading the disease
With some help from Captain Trips
He'll bring the world down to his knees
Power, yes power
He'll show them all his power
It pulses through his ice cold blood
A whole world to devour

He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living

Murder, murder
Commit cold-blooded murder
Like Nazis during World War II
They only follow orders
Hatred, hatred!
A crucifix is your bed
Once he turns his eyes on you
You'd be better off dead
He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living

I'm the walkin' dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with power
Among the living
Follow me or die

Man, fights man
Divided they can't stand
United they can battle back
And make him force his hand
Fear, yes fear!
His end is growing near
He didn't count on man's good faith
And their will to persevere

He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living
I'm the walkin' dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with power
Among the living
Follow me or die


Fire, hot fire!
Purge the world with fire
Damnation is the price he'll pay
For an evil man's desire
Good vs. Evil
The stand to vanquish evil
Man can only live one way
That place right in the middle

He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living
I'm the walkin' dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with the power
Among the living
Follow me or die

Among, among, among, among!
Among, among, among, among!
Among, among, among, among!
Among, among, among, among!Embed","The title-track for Anthrax’s most popular album is written about Stephen King’s novel, “The Stand”, which is set in a post-apocalyptic 1980.","March 22, 1987"
Anthrax,I Am the Law,"I Am the Law Lyrics
Fifteen years in the academy
He was like no cadet they'd ever seen
A man so hard, his veins bleed ice
When he speaks, he never says it twice
They call him Judge, his last name is Dredd
So break the law and you'll wind up dead
Truth and justice are what he's fighting for
Judge Dredd the man, he is the law
Drokk it!

With his gun and bike he rules the streets
And every perp he meets will taste defeat
Not even Death will overcome his might
Cause Dredd and Anderson, they won the fight
When the Sov's started the Apocalypse war
And Mega-City was bombed to the floor
Dredd resisted and the judges fought back
And crushed the Sov's with their counter-attack
Drokk it!

Respect the badge, he earned it with his blood
Fear the gun, your sentence may be death
Because...
I am the law
And you won't fuck around no more (I am the law)
I judge the rich, I judge the poor (I am the law)
Commit a crime, I'll lock the door (I am the law)
Because in Mega-City, I am the law

In the Cursed Earth where mutants dwell
There is no law, it's just a living Hell
Anarchy and chaos, as the blood runs red
But this would change if it was up to Dredd
The Book of Law is the Bible to him
And any crime committed is a sin
He keeps the peace with his law-giver
Judge, jury, and executioner

Respect the badge, he earned it with his blood
Fear the gun, your sentence may be death
Because...

I am the law
And you won't fuck around no more (I am the law)
I judge the rich, I judge the poor (I am the law)
Commit a crime I'll lock the door (I am the law)
Because in Mega-City, I am the law
Crime, the ultimate sin
Your Iso-Cube is waiting when he brings you in
Law, it's what he stands for
Crime's his only enemy and he's going to war


Crime, the ultimate sin

So cool, king of the scene
You found that making people laugh
Was more than just a dream

Yet you couldn't find your niche
Your only friends it helps you through
Helps you dig your daily ditch
The bottom line can't touch you
Cause you're above the rest
But your little friend's the enemy
And the bottom line is death

Just one too many cookies
From the batch no one should taste

Too bad things weren't different
Who knows what he'd have done

It wasn’t a pro drug song, because we’ve never been pro drug. But we did love John Belushi and his contribution to comedy. He influenced so many that came after him. It was just a shame that he died so young, and how drug use pretty much controls your life. I mean, he just loved to have a good time and he just took it a little bit too far.

It's the end of the road
It's the rest of a stump
It's a little alone
It's a sliver of glass
It is life, it's the sun
It is night, it is death
It's a trap, it's a gun
The oak when it blooms
A fox in the brush
A knot in the wood
The song of a thrush
The wood of the wind
A cliff, a fall
A scratch, a lump
It is nothing at all
It's the wind blowing free
It's the end of the slope
It's a beam, it's a void
It's a hunch, it's a hope
And the river bank talks
Of the waters of March
It's the end of the strain
The joy in your heart
The foot, the ground
The flesh and the bone
The beat of the road
A slingshot's stone
A fish, a flash
A silvery glow
A fight, a bet
The range of a bow
The bed of the well
The end of the line
The dismay in the face
It's a loss, it's a find
A spear, a spike
A point, a nail
A drip, a drop
The end of the tale
A truckload of bricks
In the soft morning light
The shot of a gun
In the dead of the night
A mile, a must
A thrust, a bump
It's a girl, it's a rhyme
It's a cold, it's the mumps
The plan of the house
The body in bed
And the car that got stuck
It's the mud, it's the mud
Afloat, adrift
A flight, a wing
A hawk, a quail

And the riverbank talks
Of the waters of March
It's the promise of life
It's the joy in your heart
A stick, a stone
It's the end of the road
It's the rest of a stump
It's a little alone
A snake, a stick
It is John, it is Joe
It's a thorn in your hand
And a cut in your toe
A point, a grain
A bee, a bite
A blink, a buzzard
A sudden stroke of night
A pin, a needle
A sting, a pain
A snail, a riddle
A wasp, a stain
A pass in the mountains
A horse and a mule
In the distance the shelves
Rode three shadows of blue
And the riverbank talks
Of the waters of March
It's the promise of life
In your heart, in your heart

The end of the road
The rest of a stump
A lonesome road
A sliver of glass
A life, the sun
A knife, a death
The end of the run

Of the waters of March

It's the joy in your heartEmbed","Waters of March was one of the most successful songs composed at a latter point in Jobim’s career. At that time, unlike in his early days, he was starting to write himself the English versions for his new songs. This one is an example of that, where he even tried to avoid words with roots on Latin; for this reason, this version has more verses than the original.

He kept the same structure and central metaphor of the original lyrics meaning. However, some specific references to Brazilian culture, fauna, flora and folklore were suppressed. Besides, the English version assumes a viewpoint from a observer in the Northern hemisphere. In this context, the “waters” are from the snowbreak, rather than from the end-of-summer rains in the tropical climate of the Southern hemisphere. Instead of only “promise of life”, there was the addition of “promise of spring”, a concept much more relevant to most of northern world.",1973

Consequence of you
There's so many people who can
Talk and talk and talk
And just say nothing
Or nearly nothing

And at the end I've come to nothing
Or nearly nothing

Later, when Tom met Vinicius the song was born completely.
When the song was written, Tom and Vinicius was  watching a girl, know as Helô Pinheiro, walking on the way to the Ipanema beach.
The song “Garota de Ipanema” was born in 1962, becoming the anthem of Bossa Nova.

So they made “poured out all their secret longing and lust” into the new lyrics.

Later, when the song was being recorded in New York, Astrud Gilberto (João Gilberto’s wife) sang the first half of the song in English to increase marketing of the song since bossa nova was becoming increasingly popular in the USA and Europe.

Quando terminou de escrever a melodia da canção, Jobim, acostumado às parcerias, chamou Chico Buarque tocou-lhe a melodia pelo telefone mesmo, e pediu que ele composse uma letra. Buarque lhe deu a primeira frase “Vou te contar…” e disse que mandaria o resto depois, o que nunca aconteceu. Jobim escreveu o resto da música por si mesmo. Por isso que Jobim brincava: “Chico escreveu ""Vou te contar”, mas quem contou, fui eu"". A canção fala de proximidade, de contato – ‘é impossível ser feliz sozinho’ (sic).

Arcade Fire,The Suburbs,"The Suburbs Lyrics
In the suburbs, I
I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving
You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting in a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore
But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again

The kids want to be so hard
But in my dreams, we're still screaming
And running through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
Meant nothing at all
Meant nothing at all, it meant nothing
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling and into the night

So can you understand
That I want a daughter while I'm still young?
I want to hold her hand
And show her some beauty before this damage is done
But if it's too much to ask, if it's too much to ask
Then send me a son
Under the overpass
In the parking lot, we're still waiting, it's already passed
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
'Cause it's already passed
It's already, already passed

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again
I'm moving past the feeling
I'm moving past the feeling
In my dreams, we're still screaming
We're still screaming
We're still screaming53Embed","The first song on Arcade Fire’s 2010 album The Suburbs. Like their other work, it’s concerned with growing up, but isn’t fictional – it’s about band members Win and Will Butler’s childhood in suburban Texas. They described it as:

Neither a love letter to, nor an indictment of, the suburbs – it’s a letter from the suburbs.""

It exposes some of the darkness and hidden fears in a seemingly idyllic childhood and introduces some of the albums' themes including war, youth, and loss of innocence.","June 1, 2010"
Arcade Fire,Reflektor,"Reflektor Lyrics

Trapped in a prison, in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness, darkness of white
We fell in love, alone on a stage
In the reflective age
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I don't know what it’s for
If I can’t find you there
I don't care

I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
But it’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)

Now, the signals we send, are deflected again
We're so connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And now we're staring at a screen
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
'Cause you're my home

I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
But it’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
Just a Reflektor

But it’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)

Just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
And just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
Just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection
But I see you on the other side? (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
Just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection
But I see you on the other side (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
All right, let's go back

Our song it skips, on little silver discs
Our love is plastic, we'll break it to bits
I want to break free, but will they break me
Down, down, down?
Don't mess around

I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
But it’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)

It’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor

Arcade Fire,Porno,"Porno Lyrics
Take the makeup
Off your eyes
I've got to see you
Hear your sacred sighs
Before the break up
Comes the silence
I'm talking to you
You say you're over it
But I know

I thought I knew you
You thought you knew me
But now that you do
It's not so easy now
That I know

You can cry, I won't go
You can scream, I won't go
Every man that you know
Would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno
Oh, I know they hurt you so
They don't know that we know
Never know what we know
And all your makeup
Just take it all off
I've got to find you
Before the line is lost
I know I hurt you
I won't deny it
When I reach for you
You say, ""I'm over it.""
But I know

You can cry, I won’t go
You can scream, I won’t go
Every man that you know
Would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno
Oh, I know they hurt you so
They don’t know what I know
It’s so little that we know
But the cup it overflows
Little boys with their porno
But this is their world
Where can we go?

Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Could you see me?
You can cry, I won't go
You can scream, I won't go
Little boys with their porno
Little boys with their porno
Makes me feel like something's wrong
It's the only world we know
Yeah, something's wrong
Little boys with their porno

And boys they learn
Some selfish shit
Until the girl
Won't put up with it
On and on and on we go
I just have to know
I'm not over it
I'm not over it
(I’m not over it)
You say love is real
(I’m not over it)
Like a disease
(I’m not over it)
Come on tell me, please
I'm not over it
I'm not over it

Arcade Fire,Afterlife,"Afterlife Lyrics
Afterlife, oh my God, what an awful word
After all the breath, and the dirt, and the fires are burnt
And after all this time, and after all the ambulances go
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on to the dead light
Of the afterglow
I've gotta know
Can we work it out?
We scream and shout ‘til we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout ‘til we work it out?
‘Til we work it out, ‘til we work it out
‘Til we work it out, ‘tilwe work it out

Afterlife, I think I saw what happens next
Oh, it was just a glimpse of you, like looking through a window
Or a shallow sea
Could you see me?
And after all this time
It's like nothing else we used to know
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on to the dead light
Of the afterglow
I've gotta know
Can we work it out?
We scream and shout ‘til we work it out
Can we just work it out?
We scream and shout ‘til we work it out?

But you say, oh
“When love is gone
Where does it go?”
And you say, oh
“When love is gone
Where does it go?
And where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?”

And after this
Can we last another night?
After all the bad advice
Had nothing at all to do with life
I've gotta know
Can we work it out?
We scream and shout ‘til we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout ‘til we work it out?

But you say, oh
“When love is gone
Where does it go?”
And you say, oh
“When love is gone
Where does it go?
Oh, we know it's gone
But where did it go?
Oh, we know it's gone
But where did it go?
And where do we go?”

Oh, oo oo oo, oo oo oo
Oh, oo oo oo, oo oo oo

Arcade Fire,Wake Up,"Wake Up Lyrics
Something filled up
My heart with nothing
Someone told me not to cry
But now that I'm older
My heart's colder
And I can see that it's a lie

Children, wake up
Hold your mistake up
Before they turn the summer into dust
If the children don't grow up
Our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up
We're just a million little gods causing rain storms
Turning every good thing to rust
I guess we'll just have to adjust

With my lightning bolts a-glowing
I can see where I am going to be
When the reaper he reaches and touches my hand
With my lightning bolts a-glowing
I can see where I am going
With my lightning bolts a-glowing
I can see where I am go-going
You better look out below!32Embed","The 7th track and the 5th and final single from Arcade Fire’s debut album, Funeral, “Wake Up” is one of Arcade Fire’s most popular songs, and the song that the band has typically closed their live shows with for years.

And every inch of skin's got a scar

I guess that you've got everything now
And every film that you've ever seen
Fills the spaces up in your dreams
That reminds me
(Everything now!
Everything now!)

Every inch of road's got a sign
And every boy uses the same line
I pledge allegiance to everything now
And every song that I've ever heard
Is playing at the same time, it's absurd
And it reminds me, we've got everything now
We turn the speakers up 'til they break
'Cause every time you smile, it's a fake
Stop pretending, you've got

(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!
Everything now!)
Everything now
Every inch of road's got a town
Daddy, how come you're never around?
I miss you, like everything now
Mama, leave the food on the stove
Leave your car in the middle of the road
This happy family with everything now
We turn the speakers up 'til they break
'Cause every time you smile, it's a fake
Stop pretending, you've got

From everything now25Embed","The first single from Arcade Fire’s fifth studio album, Everything Now, was released while the band played a secret set at Primavera Sound in Barcelona. A clip had already been released from a record shop in Barcelona, as a vinyl had gone on sale at Primevera Sound Festival before the official release of the song.

The song shares themes of technological alienation and contemporary impatience with songs like “We Used To Wait”, “Reflektor”, and “Neon Bible”, but is relatively optimistic. Although Win Butler’s narrator harshly satirizes modern on-demand culture and consumerism in general, Regine Chassagne’s piano and some passionate backing vocals turn the song into one of Arcade Fire’s sunniest anthems, as the chorus is plea to their fans to “Wake Up”, take control, and give everything they have to try to make the world and society we live in a better place for all of us. Interpreting the chorus with this double entendre, “I can’t live without it” may mean that they would rather die than live in a world ruled by callousness and greed.","June 1, 2017"

Spend their lives resenting their fathers
Some girls hate their bodies

She dreams about dying all the time
She told me she came so close
Filled up the bathtub and put on our first record

God, make me famous
If You can't, just make it painless
Just make it painless

On and on, I don't know if I want it
On and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
(On and on I don't know what I want)

Some girls hate themselves
Hide under the covers with sleeping pills and
Some girls cut themselves
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback
Some boys get too much, too much love, too much touch
Some boys starve themselves
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback

Creature comfort makes it painless
Bury me penniless and nameless
Born in a diamond mine
It's all around you but you can't see it
Born in a diamond mine
It's all around you but you can't touch it

Saying God, make me famous
If You can't, just make it painless
Just make it painless

It's not painless
She was a friend of mine, a friend of mine
And we're not nameless, oh
It goes on and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
On and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
(On and on I don't know what I want)
(On and on I don't know if I want it)
(On and on I don't know what I want)
Well if you're not sure, better safe than sorry

Creature comfort, make it painless
Creature comfort, make it painless

We're the bones under your feet
The white lie of American prosperity
We wanna dance but we can't feel the beat
I'm a liar, don't doubt my sincerity

Just make it painless
Creature comfort, make it painless

Later, on 16/06/2017, the single was officially released across all streaming apps.

The song seems to be about depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicide itself, the latter of which is symbolized by the phrase “creature comfort”.","June 16, 2017"

She also references her most public romantic relationships over the years and does not shy away from name-dropping in the process.

The song was released on November 3, 2018, minutes before an episode of Saturday Night Live aired. In a promotional clip, cast member and Ariana’s ex-fiancé, Pete Davidson, made a joke about the two’s failed engagement. Once she was made aware of the clip, she expressed her disgust in a since deleted tweet, writing:

for somebody who claims to hate relevancy u sure love clinging to it huh

She then followed her post with another, tweeting the phrase that would become her new mantra in 2018:

thank u, next

“thank u, next” debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Ariana’s eleventh top-ten entry and her highest charting single to date, surpassing her Iggy Azalea assisted single “Problem,” which peaked at #2 in 2014. Additionally, it was the first song by a lead female artist to debut atop the US charts since Adele’s “Hello” in 2015.

The music video for “thank u, next” was released on November 30, 2018, and is directed by frequent collaborator Hannah Lux Davis, who has previously worked with Ariana on videos for “breathin,” “Side to Side,” and more. The video interpolates iconic early-2000s movies Mean Girls, Bring It On, Legally Blonde, and 13 Going on 30, and features cameo appearances from celebrities including Kris Jenner, Troye Sivan, as well as Ariana’s former Victorious co-stars Daniella Monet, Elizabeth Gillies and Matt Bennett, among others. The music video became a huge success, accumulating more than 55.4 million views in its first 24 hours, becoming the biggest-ever global debut for a music video on YouTube. It would go on to break another YouTube record for the fastest video to reach 100 million views.","November 3, 2018"

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')

I don't mean to brag, but I be like, ""Put it in the bag,"" yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet

The track was teased in her “no tears left to cry” music video, and was hinted again in the “no tears left to cry (BTS – Part 2)” video.

Through her interview with Time Magazine, the track is described as an “anthemic, sultry banger.” The production is described as having “Grande’s voice layered so that it sounds like a choir, but really, is only her, multiplied.”

According to Ariana during an interview with Jimmy Fallon on May 1, 2018, “God is a Woman” is one of her grandma’s favorite tracks.

The track was speculated to be released on July 20, 2018, following Grande’s “20th of each month” release schedule for the album. At midnight on July 12th, Grande tweeted that she would be releasing the song and music video early as a surprise.

It also marks Ariana’s return to music after a hiatus from performing in the wake of the 2017 Manchester bombing attack that occurred during her Dangerous Woman Tour.

After teasing the single through a series of photos taken of her wearing a sweatshirt with the lead single’s title and through her Instagram story, Ariana broke her social media silence to confirm the single via her twitter alongside with teardrop emoji, and stating: “missed you”.

For the single cover, Ariana looks on as a rainbow rests across her eyes. Rainbows are a natural phenomenon that appear after rain, as the sun refracts through the water droplets. Symbolically, a rainbow tends to represent the idea of hope and optimism. The image illustrates the idea that Ariana’s teardrops have faded, resulting in the rainbow, and she is ready to move on.

Her accompanying music video was teased on Instagram on April 19, 2018, and was officially published on Youtube the next day.","April 20, 2018"

Arrested Development,Tennessee,"Tennessee Lyrics
Lord, I've really been real stressed
Down and out, losing ground
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messin' up
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire (home)
But Lord I ask you (home)
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talking to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyersburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)
Go back to from whence you came (home)
My family tree, my family name (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Eshe, she went down to Holly Springs
Rasadon and Baba, they went down to Peachtree
Headliner, I challenge you to a game of horseshoes, a game of horseshoes

Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Headliner, I won the game of horseshoes
Now you owe me a watermelon
Let's go climb trees and skip over rocks
Do like they do below the border
Speech's hair
Don't it look like the roots of the tree that the ancestors were hung from
But that's okay, get it cause he's down to Earth4Embed","Soon after attending his grandmother’s funeral in Tennessee, Todd “Speech” Thomas learned his brother also passed away. He wrote “Tennessee” in his bedroom studio as a way of coping with the losses. By the time he’d invited singer Dionne Farris to participate, Arrested Development had signed a record deal and was finishing it in a professional studio.

Speech explained that “the song takes you through a spiritual journey and a life journey through history in a sense, and at the same time it talks about my family, and then it sort of leads to anyone’s family roots, and the direction that people go in life.”

The prominent vocal snippet that opens and closes the song was an uncleared sample of Prince’s “Alphabet Street.” According to Speech, Prince’s lawyers waited until the album climbed all the way to #3 and then fell to #4 to demand a non-negotiable payment of $100,000. Not paying it would mean the album would get pulled from shelves.

The music video of “Tennessee” was shot at a house in Georgia that reminded Speech of his grandmother’s house. The people featured in the video include friends of the band and neighbors in the area who were curious about the shoot. Some of the props, like the slave shackles and the back house where slaves lived, were actual slave-era artifacts present at the house during filming.

“Tennessee” is considered the group’s signature song. It reached the top 40 in several countries, peaking at #6 in the US in the summer of 1992, and also topping the US Rap Chart. It only reached #46 in the UK on release, but after the top 5 success of the band’s next two singles it re-entered and peaked at #18 the following year.","March 24, 1992"
Arrested Development,People Everyday,"People Everyday Lyrics
See I was restin' at the park mindin' my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm datin'
Investigation maybe she was demonstratin'
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was goin' great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started buggin' out
Drinkin' the 40 oz, goin' the nigga route
Disrespectin' my black queen
Holdin' their crotches and bein' obscene
At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech 'cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear (boom!)
I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearin' brothers dissin' it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezin' parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me, see
I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people

I told the niggas please let us pass, friend
I said please 'cause I don't like killin' Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Actin' like a nigga and get stomped by an African
You see

I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people

The moral of the story is
You better look very hard at who you're steppin' to
'Cause you might get killed or shot and it's not worth it
Africans need to be lovin' each other and unite5Embed","“People Everyday” was Arrested Development’s second single, following their debut international smash hit “Tennessee”.  It is based heavily on the music and lyrics of “Everyday People” – a chart-topping 1969 song by Sly & The Family Stone.

A remix of it reached the top 10 in six countries including a #2 peak in the UK and #8 in the US.  It was nominated for a Grammy in 1992 and won Best Rap Video at the 1993 MTV Music Video Awards.

Todd “Speech” Thomas was inspired to write the song based on his experiences of having different views on black culture than those in his neighborhood:

…they understood they were black, but for them black was jheri-curls, it was pimping … I’d come to understand that black culture had a lot more to do with Africa, and it was different hairstyles that we could express ourselves with, like dreadlocks and braids. So I would dress like that, and a lot of the people around me in Milwaukee would sort of mock it.

These lyrics are for the original version of the song on the album, which is different than the version that became a hit on the radio. When “People Everyday” was chosen as a single, Speech decided to remix the song and give the vocals as “more melodic type of delivery”. That remix is titled “People Everyday (Metamorphosis Mix)”.","March 24, 1992"
Arrested Development,Mr. Wendal,"Mr. Wendal LyricsHere, have a dollar
In fact, no brotherman - here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me
But it means a big deal to you
Be strong, serve God only
Know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr. Wendal, that's his name
No one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
Still most of y'all come out confused
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Mr. Wendal has freedom
A free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr. Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him
But I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no
Who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
And killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far, cause on him we walk
Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh
But not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride
Realize that all in all you stand tall
Mr. Wendal
Lord, Mr. WendalEmbed","“Mr. Wendal” is a classic story-telling track about the life lessons one can learn from interacting with a homeless person, inspired by several people Todd “Speech” Thomas knew who lived on the streets in Atlanta.

It was the band’s third single and, like its predecessors, was internationally successful, reaching the top 10 in five countries including the UK and US. It samples drums from “Sing A Simple Song” by Sly & The Family Stone

Arrested Development donated half of the proceeds of “Mr. Wendal” to the National Coalition For the Homeless in the United States.

For a similar theme in a modern track, see Kendrick Lamar’s “How Much a Dollar Cost.”","March 24, 1992"

Brothers and sisters
Let me share with you some news
As I sit on my plush couch
Watching the news
There has been a rude awakening
That I have marched until my feet have bled
And I have rioted until they called the feds
What's left
My conscience said
What's left
My conscience said

As I look out my window
I see the little ones
Playing amongst each other
With their waterguns
In pure poverty
Generations of good people
In cycles of poverty
It bothers me, so I ask myself
I say, ""Are you doing as much as you can for the struggle?"" (no)
""Am I doing as much as I can for the struggle? (no)
Then why do I cry when
My people are in trouble (yo)
My ancestors slapped me
In the face and said (go)
Harriet Tubman
Told me to get on up
Marcus Garvey said the negro
You get on up

Seems that we forgot him
I seen years of people
Searching for solutions
Restitution, excuses
No more, no more confusion!
Come on, come on
Let's talk right, let's talk right
Talk up, talk up, but
Don't talk up all night!
There's got to be action
If you want satisfaction
If not for yourself
For the young ones
(The children)
The U.N., The U.S
We can't allow you
To tell us a kid in the ghetto
Is not as important as
A kid in Bosnia
I ain't with it (uh huh)
Just forget it (no)
You can't even debate
If you don't understand
Our situation (come on)
You don't want us to go
Get a gun now, do you?
You don't like to see
People running around now
Yet and still you wanna
Live like 9-Oh-2-1-Oh
While we scream out
(Yo) freedom
Five grandmothers ago
They erased it
We must acquire a taste for
Something we've never tasted
So, people, let us
Wet our palates (word)
It's either the bullet or the ballot
Come now (whoo)
Revolution now (revolution)

The album inner sleeve contains the following note from director Spike Lee:

“ Many of the artists on this project were friends of Detroit Red/Malcolm Little. Malcolm loved to dance, and to be around the music. We have attempted to re-create that music, that sound – the distinct sound of the African-American experience.
The songs gathered here, from Big Joe Turner’s “Roll ‘Em Pete” to Arrested Development’s rap anthem, “Revolution”, all in some way reflect what it means to live, breathe, die and love, as the descendants of slaves.

May we look forward to the day when Black Radio is as diverse as the music you’re listening to here.

Arrested Development,Fishin’ 4 Religion,"Fishin’ 4 Religion LyricsGrab the hook, grab the line
Grab the bait, grab the box and wait
Tackle and shackle the topic the faculty has chosen
Chosen by many, chosen by plenty, chosen by any
Man or woman who understand
The topic that's known and
 flock and clock the topic
As I drop my hook and get a bite
The reason I'm fishin' 4 a new religion
Is my church makes me fall asleep
They're praising a God that watches you weep
And doesn't want you to do a damn thing about it
When they want change the preacher says ""shout it""
Does shouting bring about change ? I doubt it
All shouting does is make you lose your voice
So on the dock I sit in silence
Staring at a sea that's full of violence
Scared to put my line in that water
Coz it seems like there's no religion in there
Naively so I give it another go
Sitting in church hearing legitimate woes
Pastor tells the lady it'll be alright
Just pray so you can see the pearly gates so white
The lady prays and prays and prays and prays
And prays and prays and prays and prays...it's everlasting
""There's nothing wrong with praying ?"" It's what she's asking
She's asking the Lord to let her cope
So one day she can see the golden ropes
What you pray for God will give
To be able to cope in this world we live
The word ""cope"" and the word ""change""
Is directly opposite, not the same
She should have been praying to change her woes
But pastor said ""Pray to cope with those""
The government is happy with most baptist churches
Coz they don't do a damn thing to try to nurture
Brothers and sisters on a revolution
Baptist teaches dying is the only solution
Passiveness causes others to pass us by
I throw my line till I've made my decision
Until then, I'm still fishin' 4 religion

Arrested Development,Give a Man a Fish,"Give a Man a Fish LyricsLately I've been in a life like limbo
Looking out of a smudged up window
We're not sure where our lives are going
Friends, it's summer outside but yet we're snowed in
Don't know where our next dollar's coming from
Living the life of a poor musician
Headliner's strong so he keeps his 9 to 5
Cutting brothers' hair as a means of staying alive
If it wasn't for the rhythm
I think we would have given up by now
This system has gotten the best of me
Now I pray for God to invest in me
My dignity, invest his glory
Give me the strength so I can finish the story
Keep on searching for the right way to go out
Coz going out is what it's all about
Huh! You can't be passive, gotta be active
Can't go with what looks attractive
Gotta learn all I can while I'm able
Headliner expresses his feeling on those turntables
When we get our chance
To make a good living of the music we program
We don't sell out just to be sold out
Brothers and sisters, do you know what I'm yapping about?
Coz if they take away our contract
We still got talent and we still got contacts
Coz we're worked real hard to get this far
We were catching the bus before we bought the car
Ya see !
Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day
Teach him how to fish and he'll eat forever
Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day
Teach him how to fish and he'll eat forever
Got to get political
Political I gotta get
Grown but can't hold my own
So this government needs to be overthrown
Brothers with the AKs and the 9 MMs
Need to learn how to correctly shoot'em
Save those rounds for a revolution
Poor whites and blacks bumrushing the system
But I tell you: Ain't no room for gangstaz
Coz ganstaz do dirty work and get pimped by mobsters
Some fat Italian eating pasta 'n lobster
Brothers getting jailed and mobsters own the coppers
So you you want out of the ghetto
First the political prisoners must be let go
And you must let go of your power master
You'll never get out without much discipline
Raise your fist but also raise your children
So when you die the movement moves on
Coz with no revolution, ain't no future in front o' y'all
Haha! Direct your anger, love
Nothing's ever built on hate, instead love
Love your life, tackle the government
The spooks that break down the door are heaven sent
And my phrase went...
Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day
Teach him how to fish and he'll eat forever
Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day
Teach him how to fish and he'll eat forever

Ashley Campbell,The Lonely One,"The Lonely One Lyrics
I wasted half of the day looking for something to take
I went through all of your things looking for something that I could break
But I left it all the same when you come home and call my name

You'll have to wonder where I go when the bar is closed and who I'm leaving with
You'll never know if that one last drink ended up as just a good night kiss
You're gonna lie awake at night until the morning light will mek you come undone
Oh baby it's no fun
How's it feel to be the lonely one

For all the times I believe you were something like fate
For all the times I bleved you when you said you were working late
No you're not the kind of guy who likes to hear goodbye

So you'll have to wonder where I go when the bar is closed and who I'm leaving with
You'll never know if that one last drink ended up as just a good night kiss
You're gonna lie awake at night until the morning light will make you come undone
Oh baby it's no fun
How's it feel to be the lonely one

Soon you'll see when you see your own laundry dear
The lipstick you try to hide doesn't make itself disappear
Now you'll have to wonder where I go when the bar is closed and who I'm leaving with
You'll never know if that one last drink ended up as just a good night kiss
You're gonna lie awake at night until the morning light will make you come undone
Oh baby baby it's no fun
How's it feel to be the lonely one
Oh baby it's no fun

É ela a menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de Ipanema
O seu balançado é mais que um poema
É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar
Ah, porque estou tão sozinho
Ah, porque tudo e tão triste
Ah, a beleza que existe
A beleza que não é só minha
Que também passa sozinha
Ah, se ela soubesse que quando ela passa
O mundo sorrindo se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo por causa do amor
Tall and tan and young
And lovely the girl from Ipanema
Goes walking and when she passes
Each one she passes goes: Ahhh!
When she walks she's like
A samba that swings so cool
And sways so gently that when she passes
Each one she passes goes: Ahhh!
Oh, but he watches so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at he
Tall and tan and young
And lovely the girl from Ipanema
Goes walking and when she passes
He smiles, but she doesn't see
Oh, but he watches so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at he
Tall and tan and young
And lovely the girl from Ipanema

I must have seemed
When he told me that he loved me
How unmoved and cold
I must have seemed
When he told me so sincerely
Why he must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence
What was I to say
What can you say
When a love affair is over
Now he's gone away
And I'm alone
With a memory of his last look
Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still
All his heartbreak in his last look
Why, he must have asked
Could I just turn and stare in icy silence
What was I to do
What can one do

When you're gone
And I'm all by myself
And I need your carress
I just think of you
And the thought of you holding me near
Makes my loneliness soon disappear
Though you're far away
I have only to close my eyes
And you are back to stay
I just think of you
And the sadness that missing you brings
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings
Yes I love you so
And that for me
Is all I need to know
I will wait for you
Till the sun falls
From out of the sky
For, what else can I do
I will wait for you

Someone to hold me tight
That would be very nice
Someone to love me right
That would be very nice
Someone to understand
Each little dream in me
Someone to take my hand
To be a team with me
So nice, life would be so nice
If one day I'd find
Someone who would take my hand
And samba through life with me

Someone to cling to me
Stay with me right or wrong
Someone to sing to me
Some little samba song
Someone to take my heart
And give his heart to me
Someone who's ready to
Give love a start with me

Oh yes, that would be so nice
Should it be you and me
I can see it could be nice

Stay with me right or wrong

She was a hell-raisin' soul

Lois could show you a time (aw what a time)

She was not a lady, but she was a woman
And that's all that mattered to me
Everyone knew Lois, wild-wild Lois
Lois could show you a time (Lawd what a time)
I miss her sometimes, even though she was crazy (ol' girl)
She was good for my mind (yes she was)

Proud to have known... Lois Malone!

We drank one to a town, down in south Alabama

Don't waste a moment wonderin' why
When everything goes wrong
You have to go on

Don't let your bad breaks go gettin' you down
Even when times get rough
And you've had enough
You still gotta try
Do it no matter what the people say
They don't even know you
Die before you let them stand in your way

Winners are losers who keep rollin' on
So go on and roll the dice

Audioslave,Like a Stone,"Like a Stone Lyrics
On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone

And on I read until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone72Embed","Bassist Tim Commerford claims that the song is about an old man waiting for death, who sits in a house alone after all his friends and family have passed on, waiting to be reunited with them.

However, while Commerford originally thought it was a song about love and romance, band’s singer and songwriter Chris Cornell explains that “It’s a song about concentrating on the afterlife you would hope for, rather than the normal monotheistic approach: You work really hard all your life to be a good person and a moral persona and fair and generous, and then you go to hell anyway.”","January 28, 2003"

Audioslave,Be Yourself,"Be Yourself Lyrics
Someone falls to pieces, sleeping all alone
Someone kills the pain, spinning in the silence
She finally drifts away
Someone gets excited in a chapel yard, catches a bouquet
Another lays a dozen white roses on a grave

Yeah, and to be yourself is all that you can do
Hey, to be yourself is all that you can do

Someone finds salvation in everyone, another only pain
Someone tries to hide himself, down inside himself he prays
Someone swears his true love until the end of time, another runs away
Separate or united, healthy or insane

To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do  (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do  (All that you can do), oh

And even when you've paid enough
Been pulled apart or been held up
Every single memory of the good or bad
Faces of luck, don't lose any sleep tonight
I'm sure everything will end up alright
You may win or lose
But to be yourself is all that you can do, yeah
To be yourself is all that you can do, oh

The song was named after an Apache Indian chief who declared war on the Southwest and drove out thousands of settlers. Cochise has been described as the last great American Indian chief to die free and absolutely unconquered. When several members of his family were captured, tortured and hanged by the U.S. Cavalry, Cochise declared war on the entire Southwest and went on an unholy rampage, a warpath to end all warpaths.

Chris Cornell said the lyrics was about “me yelling at me in a mirror.” The song has several potential interpretations. First, it could be about someone yelling that he needs to stop wasting his life away. A second, and deeper, interpretation is alcoholism as the tates will discuss. Finally, a common subject in Chris Cornell’s music, is depression and how it can seem like depression is another part of you that wants to see you dragged down.","September 25, 2002"

Things I've held sacred that I've dropped

Slow and sweetly like never before

So discreetly we won't look back

Things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet

I like playin' in the sand, what's mine is ours
If it doesn't remind me of anything6Embed","This slow-burning ballad morphs into a heavy rock song propelled by a fiery guitar solo from Tom Morello, as singer Chris Cornell reflects on the things that he’s lost and describes elements of life that help him forget those tragedies.

The song was nominated for the Best Hard Rock Performance at the 48th Grammy Awards.

The music video featured a boy who lost his father in the Iraq war and became a child boxer in order to move on and forget this tragedy. Notably, the members of Audioslave do not appear in the video. Chris Cornel told MTV in 2005 that this was a conscious choice to avoid the Aerosmith cliches from 1987.","May 24, 2005"
Audioslave,Shadow on the Sun,"Shadow on the Sun Lyrics
Once upon a time
I was of the mind
To lay your burden down
And leave you where you stood
You believed I could
You'd seen it done before
I could read your thoughts
And tell you what you saw
And never say a word
But now all that is gone
Over with and done
Never to return

And I can tell you why
People die alone
I can tell you I'm
A shadow on the sun

Staring at the loss
Looking for the cause
And never really sure
Nothing but a hole
To live without a soul
And nothing to be learned
And I can tell you why
People go insane
I can show you how
You could do the same
I can tell you why
The end will never come
I can tell you I'm
A shadow on the sun


Shapes of every size
Move behind my eyes
Doors inside my head
Bolted from within
Every drop of flame
Lights a candle in
Memory of the one
Who lived inside my skin

And I can tell you why
People go insane
I can show you how
You could do the same
I can tell you why
The end will never come
I can tell you I'm

You were chasing down
A cyclone
All alone in a field
With rail yards and clovers
I kept rolling on and never thought
You'd wind up chasing me

Settle down, I won't hesitate
To hit the highway
Before you lay me to waste
Saddle up and I'll help you find
Something to drive
Before you drive me insane

You're tired of walking and you
Loathe the ground
The sidewalk will barely touch your feet
And life moves too slowly to hold you down
With wringing hands
You take it out on me

Settle down, I won't hesitate
To hit the highway
Before you lay me to waste
Saddle up and I'll help you find
Something to drive
Before you drive me insane
So get yourself a car
And drive it all alone
Get yourself a car
And ride it on the wind

Get yourself a car
And drive it all alone
Get yourself a car

Badfinger,Carry on Till Tomorrow,"Carry on Till Tomorrow LyricsIn younger days I told myself
My life would be my own
And I'd leave the place where sunshine never shone

There's no reason to look back
Carry on (Carry on, carry on)
Beyond the shadows of the clouds
And onward to the sky
Carry on 'til I find the rainbow's end

When I see the rising sun
Then I know again that I must carry on
Carry on 'til tomorrow
There's no reason to look back

Leave this stormy day
And we'll ride to tomorrow's golden fields

When I see the rising sun
Then I know again that I must carry on

I'll rest my weary head
For the world and its colours will be mine

The Band,The Weight,"The Weight Lyrics
I pulled in to Nazareth
Was feeling 'bout half past dead
I just need some place
Where I can lay my head
""Hey, mister, can you tell me
Where a man might find a bed?""
He just grinned and shook my hand
And ""No"" was all he said

Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (and, and) you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)

I picked up my bag
I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil
Walking side by side
I said ""Hey Carmen, come on
Let's go downtown?""
And she said, ""I gotta go
But my friend can stick around""
And take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (and, and) you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)

Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day
""Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?""
He said, ""Do me a favor, son, won't ya stay and keep Anna Lee company?""

And take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (and, and) you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)

Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog
He said, ""I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog.""
I said, ""Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man.""
He said, ""That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can.""
And take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (and, and) you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)

Catch a Cannonball, now, to take me down the line
My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone

Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (and, and) you put the load right on me
(You put the load right on me)21Embed","“The Weight,” by the Band’s Robbie Robertson, appears on their album Music from Big Pink (1968).



Robertson tells a story about a traveler’s visit to a small town, but mixes biblical references into the story to create a modern parable.

This song rose to #63—the album climbed to #30.

Robertson told Rock Cellar Magazine that this song was inspired by a surrealist filmmaker. He was thinking of Luis Buñuel: “I saw about three Buñuel movies and there was a thread running through these that fascinated me because it was all about people trying to do something really good. And you think, oh, that’s great, but it would turn on them just the way things in real life can do.”

Robertson sees this song as amusing. The laughs are subtle, though: “When I was writing the song it was entertaining me, just the lyrics that I was writing, the irony of that kind of thing. It is a song that has a certain humor to it, not an obvious humor but there is a humor inside all of that.”

Robertson was first able to grasp the Band’s vibe after recording two tracks. They were “Tears of Rage” and this song: “We recorded that and we recorded ‘The Weight’ as well and when I heard those two things, I thought, there it is as clear as it can be. That’s as true to our musical experience up to this point as possibly could be.”

Robertson believed in this song from the start. But he didn’t foresee it becoming as popular as it did: “I had thought, here’s a little tune, if some of these others don’t work out as well as expected I’ve got something to fall back on here. And I didn’t recognize at the time that it was real good. When you’re inside looking out sometimes you just can’t see it clearly. But it was definitely one of those songs.”

The first pressing of this single lists the artists as “Jaime Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, Garth Hudson, Levon Helm” as The Band hadn’t yet been named.

In 1969, Aretha Franklin covered this song—it rose to #19.","January 1, 1968"
The Band,The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down Lyrics:
Virgil Caine is the name and I served on the Danville train
'Til Stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
By May the tenth, Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so well
:
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, ""La, la, la""
:
Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
""Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E.Lee""
Now I don't mind choppin' wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, ""La, la, la""
Like my father before me, I will work the land
And like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, ""La, la, la""
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, ""La, la, la""3Embed","The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down was recorded by the Band in 1969 and released on their second self-titled album. The song, written by Robbie Robertson, talks about the last days of The Civil War and the suffering of the white southerners.

The song was very famously performed at their last concert in 1976.

The Band,Atlantic City,"Atlantic City Lyrics
Well, they blew up the Chicken Man in Philly last night
And they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk they're ready for a fight
Gonna see what them racket boys can do

Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble on the promenade
And the gamblin' commissioner's hangin' on by the skin of his teeth

Everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies some day comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Well, I got a job and I put my money away
But I got the kind of debts that no honest man can pay
So I drew out what I had from the Central Trust
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus

Everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies some day comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Now our luck may have died and our love may be cold
But with you forever I'll stay
We'll be goin' out where the sand turns to gold
But put your stockings on, 'cause it might get cold

Oh, everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies some day comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Now I've been a-lookin' for a job, but it's hard to find
There's winners and there's losers and I'm south of the line
Well, I'm tired of gettin' caught out on the losin' end
But I talked to a man last night, gonna do a little favor for him

Well, everything dies, baby, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies some day comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Oh, meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Oh, meet me tonight in Atlantic CityEmbed","The Band broke up in 1977, and by the time they got back together, they weren’t quite as good at writing original songs anymore.  They were still amazing performers, though, as this soulful cover of Bruce Springsteen shows.",
The Band,Up on Cripple Creek,"Up on Cripple Creek Lyrics
When I get off of this mountain
You know where I want to go?
Straight down the Mississippi River
To the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles, Louisiana
Little Bessie, girl that I once knew
She told me just to come on by
If there's anything she could do

Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me
To the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win
And I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor
I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track
Sure enough, she had won
Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I took up all of my winnings
And I gave my little Bessie half
She tore it up and threw it in my face
Just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world
I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine
Dips her doughnut in my tea
He-he!

Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack
We had Spike Jones on the box
She said, ""I can't take the way he sings
But I love to hear him talk""
Now that just gave my heart a throb
To the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull
My Bessie can't be beat
Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

No-no, hu-hu
Lodl-lodl-lodl-uh-hu
No-no-hu
Lodl-lodl-lodl-uh-hu

Now there's a flood out in California
And up north it's freezing cold
And this living on the road is getting pretty old
So I guess I'll call up my big mama
Tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know deep down, I'm kind of tempted
To go and see my Bessie again

Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
No-no, hu-hu

When asked about the song, Robertson said:

We’re not dealing with people at the top of the ladder, we’re saying what about that house out there in the middle of that field? What does this guy think, with that one light on upstairs, and that truck parked out there? That’s who I’m curious about. What is going on in there? And just following the story of this person, and he just drives these trucks across the whole country, and he knows these characters that he drops in on, on his travels. Just following him with a camera is really what this song’s all about.","September 22, 1969"

They say that every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall

A man who swears he's not to blame

What would anybody leave so quickly for?
Ophelia
Where have you gone?
The old neighborhood just ain't the same
Nobody knows just what became of

Tell me, what went wrong

Was it something that somebody said?
Mama, I know we broke the rules
Was somebody up against the law?
Honey, you know I'd die for you
Ashes of laughter, the ghost is clear
Why do the best things always disappear
Like Ophelia
Please darken my door

Was it something that somebody said?
Honey, you know we broke the rules
Was somebody up against the law?

Everyone called Minnie Pearl by “Minnie” … except Robbie Robertson, who claimed in Across the Great Divide (p 316) that Minnie Pearl was the inspiration for his Ophelia.

And life is brief
It was all so very painless
When you ran out to receive
All that false instruction
Which we never could believe
And now the heart is filled with gold
As if it was a purse
But, oh, what kind of love is this
Which goes from bad to worse?
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so alone
And life is brief
We pointed you the way to go
And scratched your name in sand
Though you just thought it was nothing more
Than a place for you to stand
I want you to know that while we watched
You discovered no one would be true
That I myself was among
The ones who thought
It was just a childish thing to do

We got it together, didn't we?
We've definitely got our thing together, don't we baby?
Isn't that nice?

Most sources say that the original version had gone unrecorded for 21 years. As Perry puts it, White:

took the whole track, changed the whole track to the music you’re hearing now, and changed the lyrics around. The main line is instead of you’re my first, my last, my in between, he changed it to you’re my first, my last, my everything

As to why White would be brought a country western song, Perry explains:

Barry was great at taking anything you brought to him and turning it upside down and making a hit out of it. Barry could take “Mary Had a Little Lamb” and turn it into a hit. Serious. I’m very serious

The single version of the song eliminates most of the intro and is slightly different lyrically.","August 6, 1974"

Don't go changing, trying to please me

The same old someone that I knew
What will it take till you believe in me

The fuller-sounding vocals were achieved using double tracking, creating The Beach Boys' own unique sound. As with “Surfin' Safari”, some have speculated that “Surfin' U.S.A.” was not produced by Nick Venet, the officially listed producer, but by Brian Wilson.

This track featured lyrics by Brian Wilson, who intentionally set them to the music of “Sweet Little Sixteen,” by Chuck Berry, as he was inspired by that song. However, under pressure from Berry’s publisher and with threats of lawsuit, Wilson’s father and manager, Murry Wilson, gave the copyright for the song to Arc Music, Berry’s publisher.

It’s notable that “Fun, Fun, Fun,” another hit for The Beach Boys, sampled heavily from another of Berry’s songs, “Johnny B. Goode.”","March 4, 1963"

“God Only Knows” was composed and produced by Brian Wilson. Tony Asher helped Brian with the lyrics. Carl Wilson sang lead, and Bruce Johnston sang harmony vocals with Brian in the outro.

The song broke new ground in many ways. It was one of the first commercial songs to use the word ‘God’ in its title. As producer, Brian Wilson used many unorthodox instruments, including the harpsichord and French horns that are heard in the song’s famous introduction.

Although The Beatles engaged in a friendly rivalry with the Beach Boys based on mutual respect, Paul McCartney called this song the best song ever written.","July 18, 1966"

And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

But happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray, it might come true
Oh, baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Oh, we could be married (Oh, we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
But wouldn't it be nice?

Listen for the rockin' accordions and the ethereal guitars in the introduction. Tony and I had visualized a scene. We had a feeling in our hearts, like a vibration. We put it into music, and it found its way onto tape. We really felt good about that record.
- Brian Wilson

The song was written with young people in mind and expresses the “never grow old” mentality.

Wouldn’t It Be Nice' was not a real long song, but it’s a very ‘up’ song. It expresses the frustrations of youth, what you can’t have, what you really want and you have to wait for it. The need to have the freedom to live with somebody. The idea is, the more we talk about it, the more we want it, but let’s talk about it anyway.

When he was a child, his mother told him that dogs could pick up “vibrations” from people, so that the dog would bark at “bad vibrations”. Wilson turned this into the general idea of vibrations (and Mike Love putting “good” in front of vibrations), and developed the idea of people being able to do the same with emotions.

This song is revolutionary in a couple of ways. Firstly, the song is a for the time unusual form:
A B A' B C D B E
There is a lot of new material (C, D and E), where most previous songs only had A’s and B’s and sometimes a bridge. Furthermore, these new parts are not in obvious ways musically connected to previous parts.
Second, there is a ton of instruments that were completely new to this type of music, most notably an Electro-Theremin. This song and the album Pet Sounds in general greatly influenced the Beatles, which resulted in Sgt. Pepper.","October 10, 1966"

The Beach Boys,Sloop John B,"Sloop John B Lyrics
We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinkin' all night
Got into a fight
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home

So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home, yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home

The first mate, he got drunk
And broke in the captain's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone
Why don't you leave me alone? Yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
So hoist up the John B's sail (Hoist up the John B's sail)
See how the mainsail sets (See how the mainsail sets)
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, I wanna go home
Let me go home (Hoist up the John B's sail)
Hoist up the John B (Hoist up the John B)
I feel so broke up
I wanna go home, let me go home

The poor cook, he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home
Why don't they let me go home?
This is the worst trip I've ever been on

So hoist up the John B's sail (Hoist up the John B's sail)
See how the mainsail sets (See how the mainsail sets)
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, I wanna go home
Let me go home4Embed","“Sloop John B” is the seventh track on The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds album and was also a single which was released in 1966 on Capitol Records.

 It was originally a traditional West Indies folk song, “The John B. Sails,” taken from a collection by Carl Sandburg (1927).

The Beach Boys version of “Sloop John B.” was ranked #271 (#276 in the 2017 version) on Rolling Stone’s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

While the song’s music exhibits the typical surfer vibes the Beach Boys are known for, its lyrical content sheds a rather critical light on the tropical island motive often implemented and glorified by the band in their songs. This possible self-reflection ties in with the general theme of melancholy throughout the album, showing a more mature approach to life and to song-writing.","July 18, 1966"

You stick around, I'll make it worth your while

I can't stand rockin' when I'm in here
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fuckin' thorn in my side
Oh my god, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all, it's sabotage

So, so, so, so listen up, 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button
But, yo, I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now, I keep it on and on

'Cause what you see, you might not get
And we can bet, so don't you get souped yet
Scheming on a thing, that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage

Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage

Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage

I can't stand it, I know you planned it

But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place

As the first single, it was released well ahead of the album, on 01/28/1994.  In terms of genre, the song is considered rapcore, with traditional rock instrumentation (Adrock on guitar, MCA on bass, and Mike D on drums), turntable scratching, and deeply distorted bass guitar riffs.

In the “Beastie Boys Book,” Ad-Rock explains that he jokingly wrote the lyrics about the group’s then-producer, Mario Caldato Jr.  He writes, “I decided that it would be funny to write a song about how Mario was holding us all down. How he was trying to mess it all up. Sabotaging our great works of art” (p.365).


In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine placed “Sabotage” #480 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.
In March 2005, Q magazine ranked it at #46 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.
VH1’s 100 “Greatest Songs of the 90s” listed it at #19.

Pitchfork Media put the song at #39 on their Top 200 Tracks of the 90s list.



The music video played extensively on MTV.  “Sabotage"" unfolds as the opening credits of a fictional 1970s-style police show, an homage/parody of retro crime drama tv series, such as Hawaii Five-O, The Streets of San Francisco, S.W.A.T., Baretta, and Starsky and Hutch. The band members appear as the show’s characters…

Beastie Boys,Paul Revere,"Paul Revere Lyrics

Now here's a little story I've got to tell
About three bad brothers you know so well
It started way back in history
With Ad-Rock, MCA, (and me) Mike D
Been had a little horsey named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer
Riding across the land, kicking up sand
Sheriff's posse's on my tail 'cause I'm in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is getting hot, the beer is getting flat
Looking for a girl, I ran into a guy
His name was MCA, I said, ""Howdy,"" he said, ""Hi""

He told a little story that sounded well-rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand, and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip
He said, ""Can I get some?"" – I said, ""You can't get none!""
Had a chance to run, pulled out his shotgun
Quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead
He put the gun to my head, and this is what he said:
""Now my name is MCA, I've got a license to kill (yeah)
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill (yeah)
Now what do we have here, an outlaw and his beer? (uh huh)
I run this land, you understand? I've made myself clear?""
We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin
You think this story's over, but it's ready to begin
Now I got the gun, you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision, as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me
I said, ""I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter.""
I did it like this, I did it like that
I did it with a wiffleball bat
So I'm on the run, the cop got my gun
And right about now it's time to have some fun
The King Ad-Rock, that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne
We rode for 6 hours, then we hit the spot
The beat was a-bumping, and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
MCA said, ""Yippie Yo, you know this kid?""
I said I didn't, but I know he did
The kid said, (""Get ready, 'cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D, and I'm about to get money""
Pulled out the jammy,  I aimed it at the sky)
He yelled (""Stick 'em up!"") and let two fly
Hands went up, and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
(""I'm Mike D, and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect"")
MCA was with it, and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player, and I punched him in the face
Piano player's out, the music stopped
His boy had beef, and he got dropped
Mike D grabbed the money (MCA snatched the gold)
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold20Embed","Released in 1986 on Licensed to Ill, this song helped make the Beastie Boys–it’s the tale of how they got acquainted.  The title is a little misleading, as it has nothing to do with the American figure, Paul Revere; that’s just the name of Adrock’s horse, a reference to the song “Fugue for Tinhorns,“ the opening number of Guys and Dolls:

I got the horse right here
The name is Paul Revere
And here’s a guy that says if the weather’s clear
Can do, can do, this guy says the horse can do

Reportedly, the inspiration for this song came when the Beastie Boys were waiting outside a recording studio for Run-DMC, and Joseph Simmons, aka Run, came booking down the street, screaming incoherently. When he reached the Beastie Boys, he said, “Here’s a little story I got to tell…”  And from there, the two groups collaborated on the lyrics.

It’s produced by Rick Rubin, and is remarkable for the 808 drumbeat played in reverse.

“That backwards 808? If I think right, it was actually Joe, Run, from Run-DMC. It was his idea to flip the tape up. He was there, like, ‘Hey, y'all should flip the tape around so that shit’s backwards.’ Either that, or we had it on backwards and he heard it, he bugged out, and that’s when he said, ‘Y'all have to do a story rhyme over the shit.’ And he came in started writing the shit with us.” –Michael Diamond, 1995

The track was co-produced by Beastie Boys, engineered by Steve Ett, and mastered by Howie Weinberg.  Beastiemania reports that “Paul Revere” has been performed in 105 known concerts.

To Mario C—you can't front on that

Well just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris
You're eating crazy cheese like you would think I'm from Paris
You know I get fly, you think I get high
You know that I'm gone and I'm-a tell you all why

So tell me who are you dissing; maybe I'm missing
The reason that you're smiling or wyling, so listen
In my head, I just want to take 'em down
Imagination set loose and I'm gonna shake 'em down

Let it flow like a mud-slide
When I get on, I like to ride and glide
I've got depth of perception in my text, y'all
I get props at my mention 'cause I vex, y'all

So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want? (what'cha want?)
I get so funny with my money that you flaunt
I said, ""Where'd you get your information from, huh?
You think that you can front when revelation comes?""
(Yeah, you can't front on that)

Well they call me Mike D, the ever-loving man
I'm like Spoonie Gee (whoo ooh), I'm the metropolitician (yeyeyeyeah)
You scream and you holler about my Chevy Impala
But the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar

But like a dream I'm flowing without no stopping
Sweeter than a cherry pie with Reddi Whip topping
Going from mic to mic, kickin' it wall to wall
Well I'll be calling out to people like a casting call

Ah, well, it's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride
With your know, with your flow, when you're out getting by
Believe me, what you see is what you get
And you see me, I'm coming off as you can bet

Well I think I'm losing my mind, this time
This time I'm losing my mind; that's right
I said I think I'm losing my mind, this time
This time, I'm losing my mind
Yeah, you can't front on that

But little do you know about something that I talk about
I'm tired of driving, it's due time that I walkabout
But in the meantime, I'm wise to the demise
I've got eyes in the back of my head so I realize

Well I'm Dr. Spock, I'm here to rock, y'all
I want you off the wall, if you're playing the wall
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)

So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
See, I'm the long leaner Victor the Cleaner
I'm the illest motherfucker from here to Gardena

Well I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
You've got the rhyme and reason, but got no cause
But if you're hot to trot, you think you're slicker than grease

Foot on the pedal, never ever false metal
Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
My job's ain't a job, it's a damn good time
City to city, I'm running my rhymes
On location, touring around the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger, but a stable turntable
I do what I do best because I'm illing and able
Ain't no faking, your money I'm taking
Going coast to coast watch all the girlies shaking
While you're at the job working nine-to-five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden cold kicking it live

No sleep till
Another plane, another train
Another bottle in the brain
Another girl, another fight
Another drive all night

Our manager's crazy, he always smokes dust
He's got his own room at the back of the bus
Tour around the world, you rock around the clock
Plane to hotel, girls on the jock
We're trashing hotels like it's going out of style
Getting paid along the way 'cause it's worth your while
Four on the floor, Ad-Rock's out the door
MCA's in the back 'cause he's skeezing with a whore
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back
White boys got more rhymes
No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn
No sleep till Brooklyn

Ain't seen the light since we started this band
So, MCA, get on the mic, my man!

Born and bred in Brooklyn USA
They call me Adam Yauch, but I'm MCA
Like a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon
I sip the def ale with all the fly women
Limos, arenas, and TV shows
Autographed pictures and classy hoes
Step off, Holmes, get out of my way!
Taxing little girlies from here to L.A.
Waking up before I get to sleep
'Cause I'll be rocking this party eight days a week

The music video for “No Sleep till Brooklyn” was co-directed by Ric Menello (RIP) and Adam Dubin, the duo responsible for directing the preceding single’s video “Fight for Your Right (To Party).”  Dubin was interviewed for an MTV piece on the ’13 VMAs.

“It’s a little bit of a take off on No Sleep ‘til Hammersmith, which is a classic Motörhead  album, which is why there’s so much heavy metal in the song… It’s not a spoof, but it’s sort of poking fun at heavy metal.”

“No Sleep” was performed in 76 known concerts.

The song was co-written by Beastie Boys, Rick Rubin, and Tom Cushman.  It was engineered by Steve Ett, and mastered by Howie Weinberg.  “Fight for Your Right” was a massive crossover hit for the Boys, thanks in part to Mr. Rubin getting Slayer’s Kerry King to play guitar on the track.  Its adorably goofy video, co-directed by Ric Menello (RIP) and Adam Dubin, received massive airplay on MTV.  The majority of the “actors” appearing in the video were friends of the band, many of whom are identified below…



The song was written as a satirical, sarcastic jab at “party anthems”. The group indulged in this image with their tongues firmly in their cheeks, but to their disappointment, the joke was lost on the masses. “Fight for Your Right” became a frat house battle cry and the Beastie Boys became synonymous with the lifestyle they were parodying…





Fight For Your Right was performed in 17 known concerts.

Beastie Boys,The New Style,"The New Style Lyrics
And on the cool check-in
Centerstage on the mic
And we puttin' it on wax;
It's the new style

Four and three and two and one (What up?)
And when I'm on the mic—the suckers run (Word!)
Down with Ad-Rock and Mike D, and you ain't
And I got more juice than Picasso got paint
Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick
I'm not surprised you're on my dick (Mike D!)
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
What up, Mike D?
Aw—yeah—that's me
I got franks and pork and beans
Always bust the new routines
I get it, I got it—I know it's good
The rhymes I write—you wish you would
I'm never in training, my voice is not straining
People always biting, and I'm sick of complaining
So I went into the locker room during classes
Went into your locker, and I smashed your glasses
You're from Secaucus—I'm from Manhattan
You're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'
(""There it is"")
Kick it!

Father to many—married to none
And in case you're unaware: I carry a gun (Word)
Stepped into the party—the place was over-packed
Saw the kid that dissed my homeboy, shot him in the back
Man, I had to get a beeper 'cause my phone is tapped
You better keep your mouth shut 'cause I'm fully strapped
I got money in the bank—I can still get high
That's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly
I've got money and juice—twin sisters in my bed
Their father had envy, so I shot him in the head
If I played guitar, I'd be Jimmy Page
The girlies I like are underage (Shh! Check it)
Girls with boyfriends are the kinds I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike
My father—he's jealous 'cause I'm making that green (What up?)
I've got a list of girlies' numbers from the places I've been

(""There it is"")
Kick it!
You wanna know why? Because I'm—
October 31st, that is my date of birth
I got to the party, you know what I did? The Smurf!
Taxin' all the females, from coast to coast
And when I get my fill, I'm chilly most
We ragtag girlies back at the hotel
And then we all switch places when I ring the bell
I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best
But I'm fly at Fatburger when—when he's—I'm way out west (Check it)
Check; K-I-N-G A-D—whammy!
All the fine ladies, they're on my jammy
Went to the prom—wore the fly blue rental
Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental
I met a girl at the party, and she started to flirt
I told her some rhymes, and she pulled up her skirt (Check it)
Spent some bank, got a high powered jumbo
Rolled up a wooly—what'd he do?—and I watched Columbo

Let me clear my throat
Kick it over here, baby pop
And let all the fly skimmies feel the beat—
Mmm—drop

Coolin' on the corner on a hot summer's  day
Just me, my posse, and—MCA
A lot of beer, a lot of girls, and a lot of cursin'
.22 automatic on my person
Got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger
My posse's gettin' big—and my posse's gettin' bigger
Some voices got treble—some voices got bass
We got the kind of voices that are in your face!
Like the bun to the burger—and like the burger to the bun
Like the cherry—to the apple—to the peach—to the plum
I'm the King of the Ave.—and I'm the king of the block
Well, I'm MCA—and I'm the King Ad-Rock
Well, I'm Mike D—I got all the fly juice
On the checkin' at the party on the Forty Deuce
Walking down the block with the fresh fly threads
Beastie Boys—fly the biggest heads
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...
Brooklyn, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...9Embed","This is the second single — and Track #2 — from Beastie Boys' debut full-length album, Licensed To Ill.

Yesterday

There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Now I need a place to hide away

McCartney dreamed the entire melody before he arranged the music with George Martin. According to Rolling Stone:

‘It fell out of bed,’ Paul McCartney once said about the origins of ‘Yesterday.’ ‘I had a piano by my bedside, and I must have dreamed it, because I tumbled out of bed and put my hands on the piano keys and I had a tune in my head. It was just all there, a complete thing. I couldn’t believe it. It came too easy.’

The working lyrics Paul used to fit the tune before he wrote the actual words started with “Scrambled eggs / Oh my baby how I love your legs / Not as much as I love scrambled eggs.” Picking up on that famous trivia, Jimmy Fallon eventually developed the rest of “Scrambled eggs” and recorded it with Paul.","September 13, 1965"

It’s been suggested that each verse talks about one of the members of The Beatles or a self-portrait of Lennon himself. However, by his own admission, Lennon often simply filled his lyrics with non-sequiturs:

The thing was created in the studio. It’s gobbledygook; Come Together was an expression that Leary had come up with for his attempt at being president or whatever he wanted to be, and he asked me to write a campaign song. I tried and tried, but I couldn’t come up with one. But I came up with this, Come Together, which would’ve been no good to him – you couldn’t have a campaign song like that, right?

John Lennon stated that he thought the song was written as a form of blessing from Paul McCartney for his and Yoko’s relationship. They were touched by McCartney’s act and Cynthia said she would always remember his “gesture of care and concern in coming to see us.”



While it was being recorded, producer George Martin voiced his discontent with the abnormal song length. Coming in at over seven minutes long–with four of those minutes comprising the outro–Martin expressed the opinion that radio DJs would not play the song. Lennon responded with: “They will if it’s us.”

Once released, the song performed absolutely fantastically. With its seven-minute runtime, it became the longest single to top the British music charts in its day. In the United States, the song spent nine weeks at #1, making it the best-performing Beatles single. Additionally, at the time it tied for the record of longest-sitting chart-topping single.

The reaction to the song did not wane. It stayed as The Beatles' best performing U.S. single and is considered by many music critics as being one of the best songs of all time. Rolling Stone lists it at #8. It sits at #10 on Billboard’s 55th Anniversary countdown. In addition, the song is the most referenced musical performance.","August 26, 1968"

Following a period of disillusionment with the music industry, he skipped a day at Apple’s offices and went to his good mate Eric Clapton’s house. After feeling free and back in love with music, he wrote this song.

‘Here Comes The Sun’ was written at the time when Apple was getting like school, where we had to go and be businessmen: ‘sign this’ and ‘sign that’. Anyway, it seems as if winter in England goes on forever; by the time spring comes you really deserve it. So one day I decided I was going to sag off Apple and I went over to Eric Clapton’s house. The relief of not having to go and see all those dopey accountants was wonderful, and I walked around the garden with one of Eric’s acoustic guitars and wrote ‘Here Comes The Sun.’

That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how32Embed","“Something” is the first George Harrison penned track on Abbey Road. It is hailed as one of the greatest love songs of all time by Frank Sinatra, who mistakenly introduced it in live performance as a Lennon-McCartney song.

The song is likely about Pattie Boyd – Harrison’s then-wife (she would go on to get involved with numerous other rockstars, most notably Eric Clapton).

George later denied that the song was about her.

Well no, I didn’t [write it about her]. I just wrote it, and then somebody put together a video. And what they did was they went out and got some footage of me and Pattie, Paul and Linda, Ringo and Maureen, it was at that time, and John and Yoko and they just made up a little video to go with it. So then, everybody presumed I wrote it about Pattie, but actually, when I wrote it, I was thinking of Ray Charles.

The song was released on a single with “Come Together”, peaking at #4 in the UK and #1 in the US.","September 26, 1969"

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Ahh-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ahh

I read the news today—oh, boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

For the climax, they hired an orchestra of 40 musicians, dressed them in tuxedos and funny hats, and told them they had 24 bars to ascend from the lowest note on their instruments to the highest note closest to E major.

The song has often been rated as The Beatles' best, with reviewers calling it “one of the most ambitious, influential, and groundbreaking works in pop music history” and “perhaps one of the most important single tracks in the history of rock music.”

Lennon took his lyrical inspiration from the death of Tara Browne, heir to the Guinness Family fortune, who died in a car crash at the young age of 21 and was a good friend of the band’s members. He also used random newspaper stories; for instance, the “4,000 holes” line was from a real story in The Daily Mail about potholes in Blackburn.



The official music video was uploaded to YouTube on October 28, 2015. It originally appeared in their 1995 Anthology mini-series, but was taken from previously unreleased footage of the original recording sessions.","May 26, 1967"

Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt

You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

'Cause one's got a weasel, and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the heat
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters

But some feel he juxtaposes imagery of poverty with pop culture imagery, characterized by glamour and excess. Beck, however, has said that the rap began merely as an improvised poem recorded in his kitchen as a filler track.

“Loser” was anything but. Originally recorded in 1991 as a “fluke that I’d done messing around at a guy’s house”, it was not released until 1993 as a limited pressing of 500 copies on the independent label Bong Load. It quickly became popular on college radio and some alternative stations, and Geffen Records took interest in him.

Geffen’s reissue of “Loser” became Beck’s breakout hit, reaching #10 on the US pop chart and  becoming a Gold-certified single. It also spent 5 weeks at #1 on the Modern Rock chart. Overseas it was a top 20 hit in several countries including hitting #1 in Norway.

It not only launched Beck’s career into the mainstream but remains one of his signature songs, with Rolling Stone naming it one of the greatest songs of all time in 2011.","March 8, 1993"

His kids talked him into it, though, and the label liked it enough to make it a single.

Beck wasn’t just messing with hip-hop beats. As he told NME, he tried to get one of the game’s modern heroes to guest on the track:

I like the new Chance The Rapper record a lot. Four or five months ago we tried to get Chance on “Wow.” I’m not sure what happened with that.

Speaking of his ongoing partnership with producer Greg Kurstin, Beck told Lowe:

We’ve been working on this for a few years. It’s this whole body of songs that have this energy I think will be very good for our live shows.

“Wow” is definitely one for festival sets. Lyrically, it’s all about seizing the day and trying your best and going through life with that sense of wonder that’s been present in so much of Beck’s best music.","December 30, 2015"

So I can fit inside
Lies that will divide
Us both in time
See the turncoat on his knees
The vagabond that no one sees
When that moon stole your shadows
When you can't save the ones you caught in battle
Oh, don't leave me on my own
Left me standing all alone
Cut me down to size
So I can fit inside

I saw her, yeah I saw her with her black tongue tied
Round the roses
Fist pounding on a vending machine
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger
With a noose she can hang from the sun
And put it out with her dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching

And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try

And her rags were burning
Crawling out from a landfilled life
Scrawling her name upon the ceiling
Throw a coin in a fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for a midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye

Girl has become semi-famous among both casual music fans and Beck fans for its confusing and symbolic lyrics, especially the chorus, where Beck’s “girl” is described as “cyanide”, “sun-eyed”, or even “summer” by the ears of different listeners. This notable confusion has added to the appreciation many fans have for this song, one described by mans as one of Beck’s best.","July 4, 2005"

Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking about those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again

This is the only way to go

The string intro was inspired by “Theme From A Summer Place” by Percy Faith, according to keyboardist Blue Weaver.

“Night Fever” started off because Barry walked in one morning when I was trying to work out something. I always wanted to do a disco version of “Theme From A Summer Place” by The Percy Faith Orchestra or something – it was a big hit in the Sixties. I was playing that, and Barry said, ‘What was that?’ and I said, ‘Theme from A Summer Place’, and Barry said, ‘No, it wasn’t’. It was the new Barry heard the idea – I was playing it on a string synthesizer and sang the riff over it.

Belinda Carlisle,Summer Rain,"Summer Rain Lyrics
Whispering our goodbyes waiting for the train
I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain
I can hear him saying: ""Nothing will change
Come dance with me, baby, in the summer rain""
I remember the rain on his skin
And his kisses hotter than the Santa Ana winds
Whispering our goodbyes waiting for the train
I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain
I remember laughing 'til we almost cried
There at the station that night
I remember looking in his eyes

Oh, my love, it's you that I dream of
Oh, my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain
Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I say
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain, oh, summer

I can hear the whistle, military train
I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain
I can hear him singing: ""Oh, love is strange
Come dance with me, baby in the summer rain""
I remember the rain pouring down
And we poured our hearts out
As the train pulled out
I can see my baby waving from the train
It was the last time that I saw him in the summer rain
Oh, my love, it's you that I dream of
Oh my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain
Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I say
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain

Ooh, summer
Every time I see the lightning
Every time I hear the thunder
Every time I close the window
When this happens in the summer
Oh, the night is so inviting
I can feel that you were so close
I can feel you when the wind blows
Blows right through my heart

Oh, my love, it's you that I dream of
Oh, my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain
Every night and every day now
Though I know you've gone away
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain
Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I sayEmbed","“Summer Rain” is a song written by Robbie Seidman and Maria Vidal, produced by Rick Nowels for Belinda Carlisle’s third album Runaway Horses (1989).

Belinda Carlisle,La Luna,"La Luna Lyrics
I remember when I met you
All the stars were hanging in mid-air
In those moments nothing mattered
But the way you caught me in your stare
We were walking, we were talking
We were laughing about the state of our lives
How our fates brought us together
As the moon was rising in your eyes

On and on the night was falling
Deep down inside us
On and on a light was shining
Right through

Ah, la luna, la luna
The night that we fell
Under the spell of the moon
Ah, la luna, la luna
The light that will bring me back to you
The light of la luna

In the hotels, in the cafés
All the world was mad with romance
In the harbour, moonlit water
All the ships were swaying in a dance
Then you held me and you kissed me
And I knew I had to be with you
You didn't ask me, you just took me
To the tiny bed in your tiny room
On and on the band was playing
A song of surrender
On and on, the sun would soon
Break through

Ah, la luna, la luna
The night that we fell
Under the spell of the moon
Ah, la luna, la luna
The light that will bring me back to you
Ah, la luna, la luna
The night that we fell
Under the spell of the moon
Ah, la luna, la luna
The light that will bring me back to you
The light of la luna

Now I walk along the streets of Marseille
The winter sky is cold and grey
And I don't know why I left you that day
And I don't know where you are

Ah, la luna, la luna
The night that we fell
Under the spell of the moon
Ah, la luna, la luna
The light that will bring me back to you
Ah, la luna, la luna
The night that we fell
Under the spell of the moon

The light that will bring me back to youEmbed","La Luna (The Moon) is the second single from Belinda Carlisle’s third album Runaway Horses, released in 1989.

Unless you're dying to cry your heart out""

That means another day without you my friend
And it hurts me to look into the mirror at myself
And it hurts even more to have to be with somebody else
And it's so hard to do and so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
So many people to love in my life
Why do I worry about one
But you put the happy in my ness
You put the good times into my fun
And it's so hard to do and so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door
We've tried the goodbyes
So many days
We walk in the same direction
So that we could never stray
They say if you love somebody
Then you have got to set them free
But I would rather be locked to you than live in this pain and misery
They say that time, will make all this go away
But it's time that has taken my tomorrows and turned them into yesterdays
And once again that rising sun is a droppin on down
And once again you my friend are no where to be found
And it's so hard to do and so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away

Her name was truth
She was a horrible liar
She couldn't spend one day long
But she couldn't be satisfied
When you have everything
You have everything to lose
She made herself
A bed of nails
And shes plannin' on puttin' it to use
Cos she had diamonds on the inside
She had diamonds on the inside
She had diamonds on the inside
Diamonds
A candle throws its light into the darkness
In a nasty world,so shines the good deed
Make sure the fortune, that you seek
Is the fortune that you need
So tell me why,the first to ask,is the last to give,everytime
What you say and do not mean
Follow too close behind
Cos she had diamonds on the inside
She had diamonds on the inside
She wore diamonds on the inside
Diamonds
Like a soldier standing long under fire
Any change comes as a relief
Let the giver's name remain unspoken
For she is just a generous thief

She wore diamonds on the inside

Lifetimes in a day
But I die a little
In every breath that I take

Slowly drift away
Silence is the loudest
Parting word you never say

Into my veins
Now a voiceless sympathy
Is all that remains

And here comes emptiness, crashing in
It's either love or hate, I can't find in between

So now it's just another lonely day

Further along, we just may
But for now it's just another lonely day

I can resist anything but, the temptation from you
But I'd rather walk alone, than chase you around
I'd rather fall myself than let you, drag me on down

I was watching Syria
Blinded by the sunshine strip
And you, you were in the kitchen
Oh your mariner's mouth
The wounded with the wounder's whip

The great dividing range, the green, green grass
And oh, maybe it was peace at last
Who knew

Then, hello love
My invincible friend
Oh, hello love
The thistle and the burr
Oh, hello love
For you I have so many words
But I, I forget where we were, no

I was stung by all of us
The blind leading out the bored
And as per usual
You were skipping and laughing
Eyes at the bedroom door

Only time is ours, the rest we'll just wait and see!""

The spaces that have grown between us
And I cut my mind on second best
The scars that come with the greenness
And I gave my eyes to the bottom
Still the seabed wouldn't let me in
And I tried my best to embrace the darkness

With the strength of a turnin' tide
The wind's so soft and my skin
The sun so hot upon my side
Looking out at this happiness
I searched for between the sheets
Feeling blind to realise

The comfort invested in my soul
To feel the warmth of his smile

Black flies on the windowsill
That we are
That we are
That we are to know
Winter stole summer's thrill
And the river's cracked and cold
See the sky is no man's land
A darkened plume to stay
Hope here needs a humble hand
Not a fox found in your place

And no man is an island, oh this I know
But can't you see, oh?
Maybe you were the ocean, when I was just a stone

Black flies on the windowsill
That we are
That we are
That we are to hold
Comfort came against my will
And every story must grow old
Still I'll be a traveler
A gypsy's reins to face
But the road is wearier
With that fool found in your place

And no man is an island, oh this I know
But can't you see, oh?
Maybe you were the ocean, when I was just a stone
And no man is an island, oh this I know
But can't you see, oh?
Maybe you were the ocean, when I was just a stone

The hauntingly somber track is said to be Howard’s personal favorite, and is often mistaken by the audience to be a heart-felt love song. In fact it is a tale of friendship run afoul.
In a 2012 interview with Reuters, Howard explained:

We ended up doing separate things and going separate ways.
That’s what I write about most of the time, the people who come in and out of our lives and the memories that you form around them.

In 2018, “Black Flies” received a boost in popularity when it was featured as the ending track to the game Life Is Strange: Before The Storm, in a bonus episode called Farewell.","September 30, 2011"

This is a likely allusion to the novel The End of The Affair by fellow Brit Graham Greene, which is about a love triangle. In a 2013 interview, Howard expressed his admiration for Greene:

 I read a lot of books. I just finished a Graham Greene novel. I’m big into him at the moment. F. Scott Fitzgerald – he’s probably a favorite. I love other people’s interpretations of stuff. Graham Greene’s such a fascinating one, picking up all our little quirks. I see that in songwriting as well.","August 26, 2014"

Bangkok, Oriental setting
And the city don't know that the city is getting
The creme de la creme of the chess world
In a show with everything but Yul Brynner
Time flies, doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tirolean spa had the chess boys in it
All change -- don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue
It's Iceland -- or the Philippines -- or Hastings -- or --
Or this place!

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the god's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother
It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board, not looking at the city

Whaddya mean? Ya seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town...

Tea, girls, warm and sweet (warm, sweet)
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite

Get Thai'd! You're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me


Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a
Muddy old river or reclining Buddha
And thank God I'm only watching the game -- controlling it --
I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you
So you better go back to your bars, your temples, your massage Parlours...

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me3Embed","The most famous track from the musical Chess.

Any attack on these people

1956 - Budapest is rising

On the people who ran
Mindlessly over your childhood
Don't let them fool you for
Thirty years on they're the same

1956 - Budapest is fighting
1956 - Budapest is falling

They see chess as a war
Playing with pawns just like Poland

1956 - Budapest is dying

If you walk out on me
They will have won their first battle
Wouldn't your father
Have begged you to stay in the game?
He would, but he didn't know you
He'd loathe your behaviour and so do I
Why'd you have to do this to me?
What's going on around me
Is barely making sense
I need some explanations fast
I see my present partner
In the imperfect tense
And I don't see how we can last
I feel I need a change of cast
Maybe I'm on nobody's side
And when he gives me reasons
To justify each move
They're getting harder to believe
I know this can't continue
I've still a lot to prove
There must be more I could achieve
But I don't have the nerve to leave
Everybody's playing the game
But nobody's rules are the same
Nobody's on nobody's side
Better learn to go it alone
Recognize you're out on your own
Nobody's on nobody's side
The one I should not think of
Keeps rolling through my mind
And I don't want to let that go
No lover's ever faithful
No contract truly signed
There's nothing certain left to know
And how the cracks begin to show
Never make a promise or plan
Take a little love where you can
Nobody's on nobody's side
Never stay too long in your bed
Never lose your heart, use your head
Nobody's on nobody's side
Never take a stranger's advice
Never let a friend fool you twice
Nobody's on nobody's side
Everybody's playing the game
But nobody's rules are the same
Nobody's on nobody's side
Never leave a moment too soon
Never waste a hot afternoon
Nobody's on nobody's side
Never stay a minute too long
Don't forget the best will go wrong
Nobody's on nobody's side
Never be the first to believe
Never be the last to deceive
Nobody's on nobody's side
Never make a promise or plan...Embed",?,"October 26, 1984"
Benny Andersson,Opening Ceremony,"Opening Ceremony Lyrics
I've a duty as the referee
At the start of the match
On behalf of all our sponsors
I must welcome you
Which I do -- there's a catch
I don't care if you're a champion
No one messes with me
I am ruthless in upholding
What I know is right
Black or white -- as you'll see
I'm on the case
Can't be fooled
Any objection
Is overruled
Yes I'm the arbiter and I know best

He's impartial, don't push him, he's unimpressed

You got your tricks, good for you
But there's no gambit I don't see through
Oh I'm the arbiter, I know the score
From square one he'll be watching all 64

If you're thinking of the kind of thing
That we've seen in the past
Chanting gurus, walkie-talkies
Walkouts, hypnotists
Tempers, fists, not so fast
This is not the start of World War Three
No political ploys
I think both your constitutions are terrific so
Now you know, be good boys
I'm on the case
Can't be fooled
Any objection
Is overruled
Yes I'm the arbiter and I know best

He's impartial, don't push him, he's unimpressed

You got your tricks
Good for you
But there's no gambit I don't see through
Oh I'm the arbiter, I know the score
From square one he'll be watching all 64

Yes I'm the arbiter, I know the score

From square one he's watching all 64

No one can deny that these are difficult times
No one can deny that these are difficult times
No one can deny that these are difficult times

It's the U.S. versus U.S.S.R
Yet we more or less are --

No one can deny that these are difficult times

-- to our credit putting all that aside
We have swallowed our pride

These are very difficult and dangerous times
It really doesn't matter who comes out on top
(Who gets the chop)
No one's way of life is threatened by a flop

But we're gonna smash their bastard
Make him wanna change his name
Take him to the cleaners and devastate him
Wipe him out, humiliate him
We don't want the whole world saying
They can't even win a game
We have never reckoned
On coming second
There's no use in losing

It's the U.S. versus U.S.S.R
Yet we more or less are --

No one can deny that these are difficult times

-- to our credit putting all that aside
We have swallowed our pride

These are very difficult and dangerous times

The value of events like this need not be stressed
(When East and West)
Can meet as comrades, ease the tension over drinks
Through sporting links
(As long as their man sinks)

Whether you are pro or anti
Or could not care less
We are here to tell you
We are here to sell you chess
Not a chance of you escaping from our wiles
We've locked the doors, we've blocked the aisles
We've a franchise worth exploiting
And we will, yes we will!
When it comes to merchandising
We could kill
When you get up
When you get up in the morning
Till you crash at night
You will have to live your life
With bishop, rook and knight
Clean your teeth with chequered toothpaste
Wear our vests
Our kings and queens on bouncing breasts
You could even buy a set
And learn to play
We don't mind, we'll sell you something
Anyway

We've done all our market research
And our findings show
That this game of chess could be around
A month or so
Maybe it's a bit confusing
For a game
But Rubik's Cubes were much the same
In the end the whole world bought one
All were gone
By which time we merchandisers
Had moved on
By which time we had moved on

I'm on the case, can't be fooled
Any objection is overruled
Don't try to tempt me, you've no hope
I don't like women, I don't take dope
I'm the arbiter, I know the score

From square one he'll be watching all 64

You got your tricks -- good for you
But there is no gambit I don't see through
I'm the arbiter and I know best

He's impartial, don't push him, he's unimpressed

I'm the arbiter, my word is law

From square one he'll be watching you

Don't you find it rather touching to behold
The game that came in from the cold
Seen for what it is, religion plus finesse
Countries, classes
Creeds, as one in love of chessEmbed","The chess match begins!

The opening ceremony segment is in fact a medley that has been written and rewritten many times over the show’s revisions. This format begins with “The Arbiter,” then “Diplomats,” “Merchandisers,” “The Arbiter (Reprise),” and finally “Hymn to Chess.” But the orignal London production reorders it “Diplomats,” “Arbiter,” “Hymn,” “Merchandisers,” “Chess,” and “Arbiter (Reprise)”. The Broadway production omits the segment, placing “Merchandisers” and “Diplomats” early, “The Arbiter” opening Act 2 (the song being cut after opening night), and cutting “Hymn” (though the song made it to the cast album) and “Arbiter (Reprise)”. The 1990 Sydney production goes “Diplomats,” “Arbiter,” “Merchandisers,” and puts “Hymn” twice, once before, and once directly after “Quartet”.","October 26, 1984"

We wish, no, must
Make our disgust
At this abuse perfectly clear
We're here for chess
Are the U.S.?
If so, why foul the atmosphere?
I must protest
Our delegation
Has a host of valid points to raise
Our player's sporting attitude's
Beyond all praise
As any neutral would attest
But we concede
The fact his masters bend the rules
Is not a player's fault
We'll overlook their crude
Political assault
And under protest will proceed
We wish
No, must
Make our disgust
At this
Abuse
Perfectly clear
We're here
For chess
Are the U.S.?
How
Can you
Make such a claim?
If your man's so sweet
Then why his fighting talk?
If he's not a cheat
Then why on earth
Did he go take a walk?
Point 17
No one-way screen
Will be allowed
In the hall
Why let him loose?
He'll soon reduce
This great
Event
To a brawl
It's very sad
To see the ancient and
Distinguished game
That used to be
I am not surprised
He wanted fresher air
Once he realized
There was no hope
Of your lot playing fair
How sad
To see
What used
To be
A model of decorum and tranquillity
Become like any other sport
A battleground for rival ideologies
To slug it out with glee
Through the elegant yelling
Of this compelling
Dispute
Comes the ghastly suspicion
My opposition's a fruit
We wish, no, must, make our disgust
At this abuse
Perfectly clear
We're here for chess, are the U.S.?
If so, why foul the atmosphere?
I don't suppose you'd understand
The strain and pressure
Getting where he's got
For then you'd simply call him
Highly strung and not
Imply that he was one of those
Point 23
The board
Will be
Made in
Sweden
Non-aligned wood
But how
Can you
Work for one who
Treats you
Like dirt?
Pay must be good
It seems to us
There's little point in waiting
Here all night for his return
And since a peaceful match
Is our sole concern
We won't make an official fuss
I'm not getting rich
My only interest is
In something which
Gives me the chance
Of working with the best.
In short we rise
Above your guy's
Tantrums
Dramas
Dirty tricks
I can only say
I hope your dream comes true
Till that far-off day
I hope you cope
With helping number two.

No game

Benny Andersson,Merano,"Merano Lyrics
O light the heart that lingers in Merano
Merano! The spa no connoisseur of spas would miss
(So healthy)
Highly recommended is this sweet metropolis
(Mental and physical bliss!)
The gods have smiled and blessed is Merano
Merano! There are no fitter burghers to be found
(Such vigour!)
Take the time to taste us
We'll give you a welcome that's typically Tirol
For then we are sure of our ground
Right now we're Italian - we used to be German -
The border keeps shifting around

Speaking as one of the patriarchs
I don't mind taking your lira or marks

Oh I get high when I saunter by the mountains of Merano
Rosy-cheeked Merano, flourishing to a fault
The sparkling streams, the bracing air, the therapeutic salt
I'd have to be carried away to call a halt!
Oh I feel great in this bouncing state, o hail to thee, Merano
Hearty hale Merano. Any objections? Nein!
Where breathing in will turn you on, where water tastes like wine
Get out your get up and go and get in line
It's living your life in a show by Rodgers and Hammerstein!
O sad the soul who passes by Merano
Merano! So far no soul has ever passed us by
(They love us)
Why not stay forever?
Oh so many reasons why
(All those in favour say ""Aye"")
""AYE!""
So sing a song, let's hear it for Merano
Merano! Soprano, alto, tenor, bass agree
(We're wholesome)
What a happy haven
This is a place where your arteries soften
Cholesterol hasn't a chance
From mountain to valley the natural goodness
Is fighting pollution's advance

So come to us and feel the force
All major credit cards taken of course
Oh I get high when I saunter by the mountains of Merano
Rosy-cheeked Merano, flourishing to a fault
The sparkling streams, the bracing air, the therapeutic salt
I'd have to be carried away to call a halt
Once in a while all the gods will smile on little old Merano
Humble shy Merano suddenly hits the press
And I report with all the pride and joy that I possess
Half of the world and his wife has our address
Our little town will be rife with games of chess!


Get up your get up and go and get in line
It's living your life in a show...

What a scene! What a joy! What a lovely sight!
When my game is the big sensation
Has the mob's sporting taste altered overnight?
Have they found new sophistication?
Not yet, they just want to see
If the nice guy beats the bum
If it's East-West and the money's sky-high
They all come
You can raise all you want, if you raise the roof
Scream and shout and the gate increases
Break the rules, break the bank, I'm the living proof
They don't care how I move my pieces
I know I'm the best there is
But all they want is a show
Well that's all right, I'll be glad to oblige
S.R.O. S.R.O


Oh I get high when I saunter by the mountains of Merano
Rosy-cheeked Merano, flourishing to a fault
The sparkling streams, the bracing air, the therapeutic salt

Oh I feel great in this bouncing state, o hail to thee, Merano
Hearty hale Merano. Any objections? Nein!

Get out your get up and go and get in line
It's living your life in a show by Rodgers and Hammerstein!

We put the ice into paradise, we are the salt of the earth
Sound as a bell
Check out the waters and check out the hygiene at which we excel
Check into an hotel and schnell
Body and soul, get wellEmbed","The opening track from the concept album of Chess.

We find ourselves in northern Italy in the small mountain town of Merano; the town’s usual claim to fame is the invigorating mountain air, world class spas and profoundly positive effects on physical and mental health.

This year brings another accolade to the town, for it has been chosen to host the World Chess Championship; the current American champion defends his title against a Soviet challenger (here referred to only as “The American” and “The Russian”, later named Freddie Trumper and Anatoly Sergievsky, respectively).","October 26, 1984"
Benny Andersson,Anthem,"Anthem Lyrics
No man, no madness
Though their sad power may prevail
Can possess, conquer, my country's heart
They rise to fail
She is eternal
Long before nations' lines were drawn
When no flags flew, when no armies stood
My land was born
And you ask me why I love her
Through wars, death and despair
She is the constant, we who don't care
And you wonder, will I leave her - but how?
I cross over borders but I'm still there now
How can I leave her?
Where would I start?
Let man's petty nations tear themselves apart
My land's only borders lie around my heartEmbed",?,1984
Benny Andersson,The Russian and Molokov/Where I Want to Be,"The Russian and Molokov/Where I Want to Be Lyrics
The man is utterly mad - you're playing a lunatic -

That's the problem. He's a brilliant lunatic and you can't tell which way he'll jump - like his game he's impossible to analyse - You can't dissect him, predict him - which of course means he's not a lunatic at all

What we've just seen's a pathetic display
From a man who's beginning to crack
He's afraid
He knows he isn't the player he was
And he won't get it back

Nonsense!
Why do my seconds
Always want to believe
Third-rate propaganda -

My friend, please relax
We're all on your side
You know how you need us -

I don't need my army of so-called ""advisors""
And helpers to tell me
The man who's revitalised chess single-handed
Is more or less out of his brain
When it's very clear
He's sane
Listen, we don't underestimate anyone
We won't get caught in that trap
After all, winning or losing reflects on us all -

Oh, don't give me that crap!
I win - no one else does
And I take the rap if I lose

It's not quite that simple
The whole world's tuned in
We're all on display
We're not merely sportsmen

Oh please don't start spouting that old party line
Yes I know it's your job but
Just get out and get me a chess-playing second
In thirty-six hours we begin
That is if you want to win!
Who needs a dream?
Who needs ambition?
Who'd be the fool
In my position?
Once I had dreams
Now they're obsessions
Hopes became needs
Lovers possessions
Then they move in
Oh, so discreetly
Slowly at first
Smiling too sweetly
I opened doors
They walked right through them
Called me their friend
I hardly knew them
Now I'm where I want to be and who I want to be and
Doing what I always said I would and yet
I feel I haven't won at all
Running for my life and never looking back
In case there's someone right behind to
Shoot me down and say he always knew I'd fall
When the crazy wheel slows down
Where will I be? Back where I started
Don't get me wrong
I'm not complaining
Times have been good
Fast, entertaining
But what's the point
If I'm concealing
Not only love
All other feeling?
Now I'm where I want to be and who I want to be and
Doing what I always said I would and yet
I feel I haven't won at all
Running for my life and never looking back
In case there's someone right behind to
Shoot me down and say he always knew I'd fall
When the crazy wheel slows down
Where will I be? Back where I startedEmbed",?,"October 26, 1984"

Another promise fallen through
Another season passes by you
I never took the smile away from anybody's face
And that's a desperate way to look for someone who is still a child

In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive, here we go
I thought that pain and truth were things that really mattered
But you can't stay here with every single hope you had shattered
I'm not expecting to grow flowers in the desert
But I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime

In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive

In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive
So take that look out of here, it doesn't fit you
Because it's happened doesn't mean you've been discarded
Pull up your head off the floor, come up screaming
Cry out for everything you ever might have wanted
I thought that pain and truth were things that really mattered
But you can't stay here with every single hope you had shattered
I'm not expecting to grow flowers in the desert
But I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime

Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside

All the rain came down  on a cold new town
As he carried you away
From your father's hand that always seemed like a fist
Reaching out to make you pay

He came like a hero from the factory floor
With the sun and moon as gifts
But the only son you ever saw
Were the two he left you with

Oh Lord, where did the feeling go?
Oh Lord, I never felt so low

Now the skirts hang so heavy around your head
That you never knew you were young
Because you played chance with a lifetime's romance
And the price was far too long

“Holocaust” was written by Alex Chilton, main songwriter for Big Star. The composition features a creeping pace, a very minor chord progression, and sparse instrumentation. The piano and slide guitar accompanied by cello lay the foundation, but it’s the dark gospel singing, the broken structure, and Chilton’s fragile vocal that delivers the chilling effect the song leaves behind.","January 1, 1978"

Hanging out, down the street
The same old thing we did last week
Not a thing to do, but talk to you

Steal your car, and bring it down
Pick me up, we'll drive around

Bust a street light
Out past midnight

Hanging out, down the street

Not a thing to do, but talk to you1Embed","Written by Chris Bell, “In the Street” is track 3 of Memphis-based Big Star’s ironically titled #1 Record. Though it garnered heavy critical acclaim, poor distribution ended its popularity prematurely. Over the years the group has become popular with heavy pop and independent acts. This song in particular gained popularity after it was adapted into the opening credits of the popular TV show “That 70s Show.” The theme is performed by Cheap Trick.

That are spun of gold

As they whisper good-bye

A kitten with an apron on
Stop 'n start his stereo
When she knows her brothers down the hall runnin' 'round and skippin' 'round
Because she's so
She's so inspired

Please put me jammies on

Creepin' around like no one knows

Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type

Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear

I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)

The track details a confusing relationship with this ‘entity’ and ambiguously sets her up to be the monster itself.

A snippet of “bury a friend” was teased by Eilish on her Instagram page, as well as on Twitter and YouTube, on January 28, 2019. The visual depicts Billie’s face being grabbed by several gloved hands that reach in from off screen, until the closing lyrics and album title are displayed. She posted on Instagram the following day, announcing her debut album would be titled WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?

The song itself features a Prismizer effect, which manipulates pitch and frequency characteristics to achieve a choral phase, much like Eilish’s other January release, “WHEN I WAS OLDER.” Her friend Mehki Raine makes a few short appearances on the song and seems to be talking directly to Eilish.

Many fans believe an episode of sleep paralysis, which Billie shared on her Instagram story, was one of the inspirations for the song. In a reply to an Instagram comment, Eilish alluded to the validity of this theory.



On February 22, 2019, Billie posted a video in collaboration with YouTube Music, where she and her brother Finneas explain the meaning behind the song and the creation of it. When asked by Radio Energy for her favorites from the album, Eilish chose “bury a friend” as one of them.","January 30, 2019"

On May 13, 2018, she teased a 15-second snippet of the demo to her fans. This snippet was re-posted to her Instagram story on January 2, 2019, where she confirmed it to be the twelfth track on her debut album. However, it was replaced by “listen before i go,” becoming the thirteenth track instead.

When asked by Radio Energy for her favorites on the album, Eilish listed “i love you” as one of them, citing the track as, “still one of my favorite songs I’ve ever written in my life.”

In an interview with PopBuzz, Eilish confirmed that the final three song titles on the album were intended to form a sentence, beginning with “listen before i go,” then “i love you,” ending on “goodbye.”
The sentence was initially supposed to begin with a track titled “i dont know, i just wish i wasnt breathing,” but Eilish stated that the song was never completed, and therefore could not be included on the record.

“i love you” was the longest track of Eilish’s discography at 4 minutes and 52 seconds, but was overtaken by the title track of her sophomore album Happier Than Everwhich is 4 minutes and 58 seconds long, just 6 seconds longer.

Many have also pointed out similarities between the chorus of “i love you” and Leonard Cohen’s iconic song, “Hallelujah”.

Southern trees bear a strange fruit
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swinging in the Southern breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees

Pastoral scene of the gallant south
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh

Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the tree to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop43Embed","Originally written in 1937 by Abel Meeropol, “Strange Fruit” is a dark and profound song centered around the lynching of African Americans in the Southern United States during the Jim Crow Era.

The ominous lyric portrays Black victims as fruits that hang from a tree before rotting and decomposing; a similar narrative to the lynching and subsequent disposal of victims.

Though covered by a plethora of artists, “Strange Fruit” gained popularity and attention following Billie Holiday’s 1939 cover. The song very quickly transcended into a protest song, which Holiday continued to perform live despite the grave threats she received from angry detractors. Her adamancy to continue performing the song, disregarding the personal stakes at hand, landed her in prison, banned her from select nightclubs, and played a large factor in her untimely passing in 1959.",May 1939

Angels have no thought of ever returning you

With the last breath of my soul, I'll be blessing you

In her controversial autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues, Holiday indicated an argument with her mother over money led to the song. Her mother said the line “God bless the child that’s got his own.” The anger over the incident led her to turn that line into a starting point for a song, which she worked out in conjunction with Herzog.

In his 1990 book, Jazz Singing, Will Friedwald indicates it as “sacred and profane” as it references the Bible while indicating that religion seems to have no effect in making people treat each other better.",1942

I'm no good without you
Take my lips

In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me

Billie Holiday,Blue Moon,"Blue Moon LyricsBlue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me
And when I looked
The moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then they suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me
And when I looked
The moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Billy Currington,Good Directions,"Good Directions Lyrics
I was sitting there, selling turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking, ""This is where rednecks come from""
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions, and I was the man for the job

I told her; ""Way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me""

I was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat, and thought, you fool, it could have been love
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

I told her; ""Way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me""

Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me?
Or am I really seeing what I think I see?
The woman of my dreams coming back to me

She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass
And sent her right back here to me

Thank God for good directions, and turnip greens6Embed",?,"October 18, 2005"

And other times you got to take it slow
And hold her all night long

You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes

Must be doing something right

Anywhere you want to go
Baby, show me the way
I'm open to suggestions
Mmm, whatever you say
Tonight's about giving you
What you want, whatever it takes
Girl, I hope I'm on the right road
And judging by the smile on your face
Must be doing something right

You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes

This old man and me
Were at the bar and we
Were having us some beers and
Swapping I don't cares

Talking politics
Blonde and red-haired chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked

We talked about God's grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

He said ""I fought two wars
Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damned if I know""
We talked an hour or two
'Bout every girl we knew
What all we put them through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
Said ""These damn things will kill me yet""

But God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

Last call is 2 a.m
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again

Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire-y
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
Huh, but me
I'm doing well

And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
I left a six-pack
Right there on his grave
And I said

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

Beer is good
And people are crazy

I couldn't tell ya what song just played
Or the guys name that lives next door
Hundred dollar bills could be falling from the sky
Wouldn't even notice
But baby, I'm in tune with everything you do
I'm completely focused on

Every 5'7"", 3/8 inches of you, baby
How the salt in the air makes your hair kinda wavy
How you're tongue-tied when you mix wine
With the Gemini, baby, I memorized
Every brown sugar freckle that the Lord put on ya
How you lean to left, 45 degrees, right before
You're gonna kiss me
If you can't tell
I've been paying close attention to your details

I've been paying close attention to your

Iced mocha latte, one shot espresso
That you stir with your left hand
Sleep with two pillows, DVR Kimmel
'Cause your eyes get heavy and
Start talking in your sleep
Fighting with somebody
You don't think you do
But trust me girl, I've studied
Every 5'7"", 3/8 inches of you baby
How the salt in the air makes your hair kinda wavy
How you're tongue-tied when you mix wine
With the Gemini, baby, I memorized
Every brown sugar freckle that the Lord put on ya
How you lean to left, 45 degrees, right before

​Told him just how our story ends

When you see me pull up in your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown?
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country?
And maybe blow all our money
On some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind
Baby don't be shy
And tell me now

Do I
Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now?
Act just like you don't care now?
Girl when I come around tell me
Do I make you wanna?
Stay up 'til the sun
Howl at the moon
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna

Karaoke in the neon light?
Go to Vegas, stay up all night?
See if we can find a cheap flight
Little 7, come 11, baby, roll those dice
Do I make you feel pretty?
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show
Or maybe just lay low?
I gotta know now

Flyin' down a two lane road?

A limb to hang your clothes?

Do I make you turn into somebody else?
Do you feel like you can finally be yourself?

Make you wanna dance real slow?
Go
Flyin' down a two lane road?
Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Out in the middle of nowhere now
We can take it back downtown
You know I don't care now
Just wanna take you there now

43Embed","One of the most popular songs off Debut (1993), “Venus as a Boy” was written by Björk and produced by Nellee Hooper. It was released as the album’s second single in August 1993.

One of the last additions to the album, Björk recalls: “I think I wrote it in my living room in Iceland and sang it into my dictaphone. Later, by accident, we were going through sounds and I found this broken bottle sound. It wasn’t intentional but it sounded great.” Reflecting her interest in Indian culture at that time, the song features string arrangements recorded in Bombay.

A song about “a boy who saw everything from a beauty point of view”, the lyrics of “Venus as a Boy” refer to a specific person, though Björk has refused to tell who he is.

The music video, directed by Sophie Muller, features Björk rolling eggs across her face and upper body before she fries them. Björk had given Muller a copy of Georges Bataille’s Story of the Eye, a 1928 novella about the sexual perversions of a couple. A character called Simone derives pleasure from inserting hard and soft-boiled eggs for her vaginal and anal stimulation, and also from various liquids. Björk told Muller the book wasn’t about a fried egg as it was too hard. After the video was finished, Muller called Björk; she had read the book and agreed that fried egg was the wrong egg.","August 23, 1993"

Pedalling through
The dark currents
I find an accurate copy
A blueprint of the pleasure in me

(Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
A secret code carved
A secret code carved (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)

He offers a handshake
Crooked five fingers
They form a pattern
Yet to be matched

On the surface simplicity (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
But the darkest pit in me
And it's pagan poetry (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
Pagan poetry

Morse coding signals (Signals)
They pulsate (They wake me up)
They wake me up
(Pulsate) from my hibernating
On the surface simplicity (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
But the darkest pit in me
And it's pagan poetry (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
Pagan poetry

It was written and produced by Björk with additional production by Marius de Vries and mixed by Mark “Spike” Stent. The music box adaptation, featured in the song, was done by Jack Perron and the full version was later featured as a B-side song on the “Cocoon” single.

It is significant to note that Bjork once stated that the song was originally titled “Blueprint.” (Reasons are unclear what made her change her mind, but there may be some connections to the fact that Jay-Z’s Blueprint was released the same year as Vespertine. It’s also pretty hard to ignore the fact that the two previously had a working relationship, and that Jay-Z paid a tribute to “Pagan Poetry” during his 2014 concert when Bjork was in the audience.)

With all that aside, it is clear the idea of the “blueprint” was central to this song. As a metaphor for things yet to be realized, the finding of the “blueprint” illustrates Bjork’s discovery of the possible things that may satisfy her to the fullest–both physically and emotionally.

However, as the song progresses, she realizes that there is a conflict between fulfilling her physical and emotional desires. The former demands sexual freedom, while the latter demands faithful commitment, both of which are important to her. We hear Bjork hesitating upon facing her partner’s proposal for marriage–“He offers a handshake/Crooked five fingers/They form a pattern/Yet to be matched”–she has not answered him yet, and has left him hanging.

She goes onto confess that despite how she may seem on the outside, her desires are complicated.  Like pagan poetry, her feelings and desires, while undeniably beautiful and sincere, are difficult to understand nonetheless. (“On the surface simplicity/But the darkest pit in me/Is pagan poetry/Pagan poetry”) And this is further expanded by her describing her desires and feelings as a “secret code,” and “Morse coded signals.”

After a climactic exclamation of raw pleasure, Bjork now has to confront her emotions in complete silence. She repeats that she loves him over and over, as if to constantly remind herself of that fact. But we hear her as she continues to grapple with the decision whether to stay free and independent or to be bound to her partner in marriage. (“This time/I’m gonna keep me all to myself/But he makes me want to hand myself over”)

And we all know how that turned out.","August 27, 2001"
Björk,Black Lake,"Black Lake Lyrics
Our love was my womb
But our bond has broken
My shield is gone
My protection is taken
I am one wound
My pulsating body
Suffering being

My heart is enormous lake
Black with potion
I am blind
Drowning in this ocean

My soul torn apart
My spirit is broken
Into the fabric of all
He is woven

You fear my limitless emotions
I am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions
Did I love you too much?
Devotion bent me broken
So I rebelled
Destroyed the icon
I did it for love
I honoured my feelings
You betrayed your own heart
Corrupted that organ

Family was always
Our sacred mutual mission
Which you abandoned

You have nothing to give
Your heart is hollow
I'm drowned in sorrows
No hope in sight of ever recover
Eternal pain and horrors

I am a glowing shiny rocket
Returning home
As I enter the atmosphere
I burn off layer by layer46Embed","In the album booklet, the sub-title for this song is “2 months after”, signifying that this song was written 2 months after the breakup of the relationship between Björk and Matthew Barney.

Described as “a 10-minute song in which she works up the nerve to throw darts at Barney and release the fluid fury of a woman scorned. It is a Björk diss track” and “Björk’s 10-minute version of Big Sean’s ‘I Don’t Fuck With You’”, Björk commented to Pitchfork:

I was really embarrassed about that song. I can still hardly listen to it.

During an interview for Grapevine.is she clarified why the song is so long:

It’s like, when you’re trying to express something and you sort of start, but  then nothing comes out. You can maybe utter five words and then you’re just stuck in the pain. And the chords in-between, they sort of represent that. […] We called them “the freezes”, these moments between the verses. They’re longer than the verses, actually. It’s just that one emotion when you’re stuck. It is hard, but it’s also the only way to escape the pain, just going back and having another go, trying to make another verse.

The music video was directed by Andrew Huang and was initially only available at Björk’s MoMA exhibit. A trailer of the music video was uploaded on MoMAvideos on February 13th, 2015, and the full music video was uploaded to Björk’s YouTube channel on June 9th.","March 1, 2015"

And who has coagulated
Who can share and
Who has shut down the chances?

We live on a mountain
Right at the top
There's a beautiful view
From the top of the mountain
Every morning I walk towards the edge
And throw little things off
Like car parts, bottles and cutlery
Or whatever I find lying around

It's become a habit
A way to start the day

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you
I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

It's early morning
No one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make
On their way down
I follow with my eyes till they crash
I imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks
And when it lands
Will my eyes be closed or open?

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you
I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you
I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier

The song is a dedication to Björk’s close friend Jóhanna “Jóga” Jóhannsdóttir. She at that time was the wife of the future Mayor of Reykjavik Jón Gnarr and also her personal assistant during the shooting of Dancer in the Dark. This song in a way describes her homeland Iceland and compares it to her state of mind.



The lyrics were co-written by Icelandic poet and novelist, Sjón, a friend of Björk since the The Sugarcubes era. She spoke of her difficulty in writing these lyrics in a 1998 MuchMusic interview:

I tried to write that tune but, I mean, I just wanted mainly to write lyrics. It was just pathetic. I was like “her… her…” it was like “love… love…” I couldn’t even put it into words. So, you know, it’s – yeah, it’s probably the—I think it’s the fiercest love song I have written, I think.""","September 22, 1997"

Black Eyed Peas,#WHERESTHELOVE,"#WHERESTHELOVE Lyrics
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on?
Can we all just get along?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love)

Yo, what's going on with the world, momma?
(Where's the love)
Yo, people living like they ain't got no mommas
(Where's the love)
I think they all distracted by the drama and attracted to the trauma, mama
(Where's the love)
I think they don't understand the concept or the meaning of karma
(Where's the love)

Overseas, yeah, they trying to stop terrorism
(Where's the love)
Over here on the streets, the police shoot
The people put the bullets in 'em
(Where's the love)
But if you only got love for your own race
(Where's the love)
Then you're gonna leave space for others to discriminate
(Where's the love)
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how hate works and operates
Man, we gotta set it straight
Take control of your mind, just meditate
And let your soul just gravitate to the love
So the whole world celebrate it

People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on?
Can't we all just get along?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love)

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
(Where's the love)
New days are strange, is the world insane?
(Where's the love)
Nation droppin' bombs killing our little ones
(Where's the love)
Ongoing suffering as the youth die young
(Where's the love)
Where's the love when a child gets murdered, or a cop gets knocked down?
Black lives, not now
Everybody matter to me, all races
Y'all don't like what I'm sayin'? Haterade, tall cases
Everybody hate somebody, guess we all racist
Black Eyed Peas do a song about love and y'all hate this
All these protest with different colored faces
We was all born with a heart, why we gotta chase it?
And every time I look around

Every time I look up, every time I look down
No one's on a common ground
(Where's the love)
And if you never speak truth, then you never know how love sounds
(Where's the love)
And if you never know love, then you never know God, wow
(Where's the love)
Where's the love y'all? I don't, I don't know
Where's the truth y'all? I don't know
People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Could you practice what you preach?
Would you turn the other cheek?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love, where's the love)
Love is the key
(Where's the love)
Love is the answer
(Where's the love)
Love is the solution
(Where's the love)
They don't want us to love
(Where's the love)
Love is powerful
(Where's the love)

My mama asked me why I never vote, never vote
Cause policemen want me dead and gone, dead and gone
That election looking like a joke, such a joke, man
And the weed man still sellin' dope, oh no
Somebody gotta give these niggas hope, please hope
All he ever wanted was a smoke, my gosh
Said he can't breathe with his hands in the air
Layin' on the ground died from a choke

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
As I'm gettin' older y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas
What happened to the love and the values of humanity?
(Where's the love)
What happened to the love and the fairness and equality?
(Where's the love)
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
(Where's the love)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
(Where's the love)34Embed","“#WHERESTHELOVE” is a modern transformation of The Black Eyed Peas' 2003 hit “Where’s The Love?” The 2016 update addresses various social justice issues such as the protest of unnecessary violence, police brutality, and discrimination based on race (including refugee and immigration issues), gender and religious beliefs across the world.

Black Sabbath,Paranoid,"Paranoid Lyrics

Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long, I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me occupy my brain?
Whoa, yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind


Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so, as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could, but it's too late51Embed","This song by Black Sabbath is consistently ranked as one of the greatest heavy metal songs of all time. Maybe the biggest hit of Ozzy’s group, along with “Iron Man.”

The lyrics were written by and about bassist Geezer Butler, whom the band often called paranoid, even though he didn’t know what the word meant. They are about Butler’s feelings as a depressed teenager and him thinking he was going insane.

According to the band, the song only took 20 minutes to write. It was supposed to be just a filler song and the album was supposed to be called War Pigs. When they released it as a single and it got very popular, however, the record label wanted them to name the album Paranoid.","September 18, 1970"
Black Sabbath,Iron Man,"Iron Man Lyrics
I am Iron Man

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or, if he moves, will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again
58Embed","The guitar riff on this song is considered one of the most famous in rock history, and it is what the entire song was written around. And no, it’s not related to the Marvel character, who was created eight years earlier in 1963.

Via Time:

The alarming, dissonant guitar groan that kicks off “Iron Man,” eventually cohering into a primal five-note riff, struck lead singer Ozzy Osbourne as evoking “a big iron bloke walking about.”","September 18, 1970"
Black Sabbath,War Pigs,"War Pigs Lyrics

Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields, the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh, Lord, yeah

Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor, yeah
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah

Now, in darkness, world stops turning
Ashes where their bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment, God is calling
On their knees, the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
Oh, Lord, yeah
52Embed","As the opening track of the influential Black Sabbath album, Paranoid, “War Pigs” was originally titled “Walpurgis.” Walpurgis Night takes place on the 30th April to mark the eve of the feast day of Saint Walpurga, an 8th-century English missionary to the Frankish Empire. It is also believed to be the night of a witches’ meeting or sabbath. The instrumental outro is entitled, “Luke’s Wall.”

The song talks about war and—like the hippies—Black Sabbath was totally against it, specifically the Vietnam War (occurring at the time), and although Geezer Butler has stated that:

[“War Pigs” is] totally against the Vietnam War, about how these rich politicians and rich people start all the wars for their benefit and get all the poor people to die for them.

And in an interview with Mojo in 2017:

Britain was on the verge of being brought into it, there was protests in the street, all kinds of anti-Vietnam things going on. War is the real Satanism. Politicians are the real Satanists. That’s what I was trying to say.

Ozzy Osbourne has said that:

[The group] knew nothing about Vietnam. It’s just an anti-war song.","September 18, 1970"

Butler later referred to it as

just a humorous take on Satan falling in love.

Ozzy and Iommi also stated that

the title has nothing to do with the content of the song.

The famous bass solo by Geezer Butler at the beginning of the song is named “Bassically.”","February 13, 1970"

So, it's on and on and on
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well, yeah

The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming

So, it's on and on and on

It goes on and on and on
Heaven and Hell, I can tell
Fool, fool

Oh-oh, oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Yeah-yeah, yeah
Well, if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer
But nobody bleeds for the dancer

And it's on and on, on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on


They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you gotta ride it well
The world is full of Kings and Queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well
And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's Heaven and Hell, oh no!
Fool, fool!
You've got to bleed for the dancer!
Fool, fool!
Look for the answer!
Fool, fool, fool!
25Embed","This is the song that Ronnie James Dio was most proud of to have ever written. It was definitely the most famous Dio-era song from Black Sabbath, being played at virtually every concert when Dio was with the band.

Dio has said that the lyrics are about which path we take. Whether it be the path to Heaven, or the path to Hell. He said this song was written for the religious people who force you to do things and make you think that everything is evil. This song is supposed to tell you to choose your own path, which makes you a good person.

In the liner notes to the 2003 compilation Stand Up And And Shout: The Anthology, Ronnie James Dio had this to say:

“You never write a song and say, “I’ve just written an epic,” because that’s not for you to judge–it’s for the people. All these years later, I listen to this song and say, “Yeah, they’re right, it’s a great song,” and Heaven And Hell (1980) was just one great album. it’s usually the first project you do with new musicians that turns out to be the best. Tony and I had some real magic going on in the studio on this one.”

In the liner notes to the 2010 Deluxe Edition reissue of Heaven And Hell, Ronnie James Dio had this to say:

“I always wanted to write a song called ‘Heaven And Hell’, and it expounds [on] my belief that the Earth can be a place for good and bad – how you live is up to you. […] The lyric is true: the world is full of kings and queens who’ll blind your eyes and steal your dreams. Life is full of inconsistency.”","April 21, 1980"

Figure in black which points at me

Telling people their desire

Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh, no, no, please, God, help me

Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no13Embed","While earlier tracks by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Iron Butterfly still cause debates over whether they’re hard rock or heavy metal, Black Sabbath’s debut album and its title track are undeniably the evil, distorted, and aggressive development of hard rock, blues rock, and psychedelic rock which would later be dubbed heavy metal music. Its slow, heavy sound until the outro is a precursor to the heavy metal subgenre known as doom metal.

Rob Halford—vocalist of Judas Priest—described “Black Sabbath” as “the most evil track ever that’s been written,” a title now commonly repeated and reaffirmed by fans.

Black Sabbath,Changes,"Changes Lyrics
I feel unhappy, I feel so sad
I've lost the best friend that I ever had
She was my woman, I loved her so
But it's too late now, I've let her go

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

We shared the years, we shared each day
In love, together, we found the way
But soon, the world had its evil way
My heart was blinded, love went astray

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

It took so long to realise
And I can still hear her last goodbyes
Now, all my days are filled with tears
Wish I could go back and change these years
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes15Embed","First appearing on Vol. 4 in 1972, “Changes” is a piano ballad mainly inspired by drummer Bill Ward’s ongoing breakup with his first wife. As explained in Osbourne’s autobiography, while in the studio and experimenting with the piano, guitarist Tony Iommi composed the song’s sentimental melody. This was later accompanied by bassist Geezer Butler’s lyrics.

Ozzy Osbourne later re-recorded the ballad as a duet with his daughter, Kelly Osbourne, three decades later in 2003. For this version, which reached No. 1 in the UK singles chart, the lyrics were revised to reflect their relationship and moments of their life together. In this revised version, the lyrics portray the changing relationship of a father and daughter drifting apart.","September 25, 1972"

I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
I've got a stalk of sinsemilla

Don't cut down the cali tree
Cause it makes the best tea for me
And the doctor says it gives naturally
One thing this doctor will need
A lot of food
To survive and go to in Babylon

I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
Yes I've walked the streets and seen children down town
Begging everyone they see and it hurt me
It can’t be right what this world do for the youth
And (for)the little herb i´m selling they want to capture me
I and I don't cherish wickedness
Because it's none profit to I and I
I've got a stalk of sinsemilla

I and I don't take for it
Pass it, pass it
All over I and I

Growing in my back yard
I've got a stalk of sinsemilla

There is a red house over yonder
Full of marijuana
I've been sitting on the corner
Chatting up with the farmer

I've got a stalk of sinsemilla

Heal the sick

broke up shortly after releasing their self-titled album, this song remained one of the most popular songs in rock music, with numerous other artists performing cover versions.

The most popular interpretation of the song is that it’s a song about being wasted on drugs and needing help to get clean. However considering that Blind Faith; the album this song was released under, had another song with religious undertones, it could be about religion and the quest for self -rediscovery. Either way the song clearly operates on the theme of being lost, and needing to return to one’s own roots.","August 1, 1969"

The song was produced entirely acoustically and features an upright bass, cello, and brushes on the drums. The track is also the only blink-182 track to-date in which Travis uses brushes instead of drumsticks.

Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus wrote the song in a two-part way, combining two songs together to make this track. The song was inspired by The Cure’s song “The Lovecats” and contains a reference to the film The Nightmare Before Christmas.

The track went on to inspire The Chainsmokers‘ “Closer.”","November 18, 2003"

DeLonge wrote this song about his then-girlfriend and eventual wife, Jenna Jenkins. His anecdotes—like the one about her leaving flowers on the stairs, are actually true. In a Rolling Stone profile from the year this song came out, Hoppus said:

Tom is totally, 100 percent faithful to his girlfriend. He’s pretty straightforward: He hangs out with his girlfriend, and he believes in aliens.

It was the last song the pop punk trio recorded for their third album Enema of the State and was one of three singles from the album that launched them into mainstream success. That album would remain their most successful album to date.

DeLonge began this song with a guitar riff and wanted to make a song with a lot of “na na na’s,” a homage to his punk idols, the Ramones. He told Kerrang!:

Because it was so simple, it wasn’t so much fun to play. But once we put it all together, and played it as a band, we all looked at each other and said, ‘This song’s huge!’

The video for this song is a parody of the Backstreet Boys video for “I Want It That Way”. Mark Hoppus met his wife, Skye Everly, an MTV executive, on the set of the video shoot.","June 1, 1999"

The original title was “Peter Pan Complex,” but their record company (MCA) changed it, believing people wouldn’t understand its meaning.

The song follows a character (most probably Mark Hoppus himself) who is 23 years old but still acts like a child. He pulls up pranks and jokes that annoy people and is left wondering if he is portraying his real age. He finally concludes that he shouldn’t care what people think of him and continues his childish ways.","June 1, 1999"

To pass the time in my room alone97Embed","A popular song by Blink-182 describing a young boy’s suicide note. It’s a break from their usual light-hearted material, but the end is still life affirming as he decides not to go through with it.

“Adam” is used as a metaphor towards Mark’s depression he experienced while on tour with Blink-182. He stated:

Tom and Travis always had girlfriends waiting back home, so they had something to look forward to at the end of the tour. But I didn’t, so it was always like, I was lonely on tour, but then I got home and it didn’t matter because there was nothing there for me anyway.

“Adam’s Song” is also commonly attributed to the urban myth of Adam Krieger, a fictional character whose suicide letter is falsely portrayed as being the original letter that the band received before writing the song. This fake suicide letter, that is often posted online via places like tumblr, is fictitional and was originally written for a play.

The song’s title is also a reference to a skit from the cult classic HBO sketch show, “Mr. Show With Bob and David”, where in the sketch a band called Titanica writes a song called “Try Again (Adam’s Song)” with the intent of encouraging a fan to kill himself so they won’t be able to take him on tour after said fan tried to kill himself after hearing their song “Try Suicide.”","June 1, 1999"

Get ready for action!

I got no regret right now (I'm feelin' this!)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feelin' this!)
Let me go in her room (I'm feelin' this!)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way you move (I'm feelin' this!)
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feelin' this!)
I love all the things you do (I'm feelin' this!)

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feelin' this!)
Our breathing's got too loud (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feelin' this!)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feelin' this!)
Take me away from here (I'm feelin' this!)
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

This place was never the same again after you
Came and went, how could you say you meant anything
Different to anyone standing alone on the
Street with a cigarette on the first night we met
Look to the past and remember and smile
And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
I'm not in this scene, I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)

For the writing of this song, Tom and Mark had the idea of getting into two different rooms to write lyrics. Tom wrote (the verses) about the physicality of sex while Mark wrote (the chorus) about the passionate side. When combined, they gave us “Feeling This.”","October 2, 2003"

The timing and structure, did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short, I'm writing the report
On losing and failing, when I move, I'm flailing now

And it's happened once again, I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands, and sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone, and I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well, I guess this is growing up

Well, I guess this is growing up

And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last, when he's gone, I won't come back
And it'll happen once again, you'll turn to a friend

Here’s what California producer John Feldmann had to say about the song:


Skiba came up with the “Bauhaus” lyric and we were talking about that…How many Blink fans are going to even know who Bauhaus is? At the end we decided “Who gives a fuck?” and did what we want. It’s a fun line! It was song originally called “Orange County Girl.” Mark’s wife is from Orange County. We wanted to write a classic, no-brainer pop-punk song: major key, fun, happy, classic. We wrote that one pretty early on. It kind of got shelved because it felt too happy compared to the rest of the record.

Travis really drove a couple of these songs home. He came back to this one and said, “Dude, we cannot leave this song off the record. It’s too important for the Take Off Your Pants & Jacket-era of Blink.” There’s no drama. There’s no heaviness to it. It’s about this girl who is a little bit out of her mind but we love her.","July 1, 2016"

Initially called “Once I Had A Love”, and referred to as “The Disco Song,” it was one of the first Blondie songs to be written, albeit with a disco beat and a slower pace, until it was arranged and re-recorded as a more Pop-oriented tune, to sound the way it sounds now.

The original 8 minute long version produced and co-written by European Giorgio Moroder (aka “The Italian Disco King”) was trimmed to 3 minutes and 33 seconds for the radio edit, whilst the video mix was a mere 2 minutes 15 seconds.

The song was written for the soundtrack of the film American Gigolo. The song’s music had been initially offered to Fleetwood Mac’s Stevie Nicks, but due to contractual conflicts she had to decline.

Two of the better filmed versions of the song are the performance of Debbie Harry as a guest on The Muppet Show and the performance with Shirley Manson of Garbage.

The song was also recorded in Spanish, called “Llámame” and released simultaneously with the English version.","February 1, 1980"

From Blondie’s most successful album Parallel Lines and their departure from New Wave to pure pop/rock. It followed their first number 1 US hit “Heart of Glass”.

It was their first album under the guidance of Mike Chapman, who recalled –

The Blondies were tough in the studio, real tough. None of them liked each other, except Chris and Debbie, and there was so much animosity. They were really, really juvenile in their approach to life—a classic New York underground rock band—and they didn’t give a fuck about anything

Though never issued as a single in the UK, the song was covered and charted in the UK by One Diection, as a mashup – “One Way Or Another (Teenage Kicks)” – with  The Undertones' “Teenage Kicks”.

Barely breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

Back to back, sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face, sightless solitude
And it's finger popping
24-hour shopping in rapture

DJ spinnin' I said, ""My My""

France Soir c'est pas Flash et Nous Deux

And you don't stop, sure shot

And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe to toe, don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eatin' bars, yeah wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall

Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
Said don't stop to punk rock
Man to man, body muscular
Seismic decibel, bite the jugular
Wall to wall, tea time technology
And a digital ladder
No sign of bad luck in rapture

Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars
Won't eat up bars where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars stopped eatin' cars
And eatin' bars and now he only eats guitars, get up8Embed","People argue over this song’s place in the history of rap. Was it… the first rap song? The first commercial rap song? The first rap song to sell X number of copies / place X on the Billboard charts? The first rap song by a female to be one of the above?

The answer to all of the above is “not really,” but it admittedly depends on your definitions. And while “Rapper’s Delight” was released first, and was the first rap song to appear on the US Pop Chart, “Rapture” was the first #1 nationally-charting song of its nature.  It was also a top 40 hit in several countries overseas.

Fab Five Freddy, who appears in the song’s music video, puts it this way:

For a lot of the white, mainstream public, it was the first time that they heard anybody rap, and it kinda paved the way, you could say, for what was about to come.

First, it is a notable example of early metal, known in retrospect as “stoner metal” due to its psychedelic traits. Other “stoner” bands include Iron Butterfly and Black Sabbath.

Second, instead of the response lyrics of the Cochrane and Who versions, this version features “mini solos” performed by each member of the band.

Tell me what's wrong

Whoa so goddamn long
Oh, won't somebody

There came an angel
She spread her wings
Now don't nobody
Tell me what's wrong

Some people talk about the blues
They're just handing you their news
It's the call of our love
But no matter how we try
We just try to get high
Cause the good times are so hard to find
Have you got the time to share
Have you taken proper care
Of your body, anybody?
No one seems to see the signs
They reject them every time
Cause the good times are so hard to find
Good times are so hard to find!
Good times are so hard to find!
Good times
When I think of fun I think of you
Find out I can make it new
The light, just one night
Getting' on which is hers
Getting' harder everyday
Cause good times are so hard to find

They're just handing you their news
It's the call of our love
But no matter how we try
We just try to get high

It's so nice to feel the colors
All days when you are new
You close your eyes
And feel the foam of silence
Running home and cease to happen
Phase across the path of time

That heaven left behind
I can see you when you're laughing

Your head is glowing
Overflowing with good times
Listen for the water droplets
Falling from the ledge
Of birds you heard from grapevine sounds
Of people that you need. (Oh!)

Bo Diddley,Who Do You Love?,"Who Do You Love? Lyrics
I walk 47 miles of barbed wire
I use a cobra-snake for a necktie
I got a brand new house on the roadside
Made from rattlesnake hide
I got a brand new chimney made on top
Made out of a human skull
Now come on take a walk with me, Arlene
And tell me, who do you love?

Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Who do you love?

Tombstone hand and a graveyard mind
Just 22 and I don't mind dying

Who do you love?

Heard a bump and somebody screamed

Bob Dylan,Blowin’ in the Wind,"Blowin’ in the Wind Lyrics
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must the white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
'Fore it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind44Embed","“Blowin' in the Wind” is Bob Dylan’s first single of his second album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.

In this song, Dylan poses a list of hypothetical questions; questions people may say cannot be answered, comparing them to the Civil Rights Struggle. An anthem for black people during the 60s, it even inspired Sam Cooke to write “A Change is Gonna Come”. Dylan does not claim to know the answers, but beautifully says the answers are out there ‘blowin’ in the wind.'

The melody of “Blowin' in the Wind” is Dylan’s adaptation of the old Negro spiritual “No More Auction Block”. Dylan acknowledged the source when he told journalist Marc Rowland: “‘Blowin’ in the Wind' has always been a spiritual. I took it off a song called ‘No More Auction Block’ – that’s a spiritual and ‘Blowin’ in the Wind' follows the same feeling.” – WP



Bob Dylan claimed that it took him ten minutes to write this song in a small café. The song deals with various hypothetical questions surrounding the elements of peace, war, and freedom. Specifically, the song dealt with the civil rights movement.

The song is actually based off an old spiritual “No More Auction Block”, sung by African slaves who fled after Britain abolished slavery. Later on, the song also became adopted as an anthem for the anti-war movement.

When asked about the specific subject of the song Dylan said, “It can mean anything to anybody. It’s critical and it’s hard, this litany of questions about what’s wrong with the world.” If one had to choose one subject to label the song, it would be a song asking “why”. In other words, it asks why we have the issues we do in our world. The answer is blowin’ in the wind.","May 27, 1963"
Bob Dylan,Murder Most Foul,"Murder Most Foul Lyrics
'Twas a dark day in Dallas, November '63
A day that will live on in infamy
President Kennedy was a-ridin' high
Good day to be livin' and a good day to die
Being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb
He said, ""Wait a minute, boys, you know who I am?""
""Of course we do, we know who you are""
Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car
Shot down like a dog in broad daylight
Was a matter of timing and the timing was right
You got unpaid debts, we've come to collect
We're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect
We'll mock you and shock you and we'll grin in your face
We've already got someone here to take your place
The day they blew out the brains of the king
Thousands were watching, no one saw a thing
It happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise
Right there in front of everyone's eyes
Greatest magic trick ever under the sun
Perfectly executed, skillfully done
Wolfman, oh Wolfman, oh Wolfman, howl
Rub-a-dub-dub, it's a murder most foul

Hush, little children, you'll understand
The Beatles are comin', they're gonna hold your hand
Slide down the banister, go get your coat
Ferry 'cross the Mersey and go for the throat
There's three bums comin' all dressed in rags
Pick up the pieces and lower the flags
I'm goin' to Woodstock, it's the Aquarian Age
Then I'll go over to Altamont and sit near the stage
Put your head out the window, let the good times roll
There's a party going on behind the Grassy Knoll
Stack up the bricks, pour the cement
Don't say Dallas don't love you, Mr. President
Put your foot in the tank and then step on the gas
Try to make it to the triple underpass
Blackface singer, whiteface clown
Better not show your faces after the sun goes down
Up in the red light district, like a cop on the beat
Living in a nightmare on Elm Street
When you're down on Deep Ellum, put your money in your shoe
Don't ask what your country can do for you
Cash on the barrelhead, money to burn
Dealey Plaza, make a left-hand turn
I'm going down to the crossroads, gonna flag a ride
The place where faith, hope, and charity died
Shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can
See if you can shoot the invisible man
Goodbye, Charlie, goodbye, Uncle Sam
Frankly, Miss Scarlett, I don't give a damn
What is the truth, and where did it go?
Ask Oswald and Ruby, they oughta know
""Shut your mouth,"" said a wise old owl
Business is business, and it's a murder most foul
Tommy, can you hear me? I'm the Acid Queen
I'm riding in a long, black Lincoln limousine
Ridin' in the back seat next to my wife
Headed straight on in to the afterlife
I'm leaning to the left, I got my head in her lap
Oh Lord, I've been led into some kind of a trap
Where we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give
We're right down the street, from the street where you live
They mutilated his body and they took out his brain
What more could they do? They piled on the pain
But his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at
For the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that
Freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me
I hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free
Send me some lovin', then tell me no lie
Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by
Wake up, little Susie, let's go for a drive
Cross the Trinity River, let's keep hope alive
Turn the radio on, don't touch the dials
Parkland Hospital, only six more miles
You got me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead
That magic bullet of yours has gone to my head
I'm just a patsy like Patsy Cline
Never shot anyone from in front or behind
I've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear
I'm never gonna make it to the new frontier
Zapruder's film, I've seen that before
Seen it thirty-three times, maybe more
It's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean
Ugliest thing that you ever have seen
They killed him once and they killed him twice
Killed him like a human sacrifice
The day that they killed him, someone said to me, ""Son
The age of the Antichrist has just only begun""
Air Force One comin' in through the gate
Johnson sworn in at 2:38
Let me know when you decide to throw in the towel
It is what it is, and it's murder most foul
What's new, pussycat? What'd I say?
I said the soul of a nation been torn away
And it's beginning to go into a slow decay
And that it's thirty-six hours past Judgment Day
Wolfman Jack, he's speaking in tongues
He's going on and on at the top of his lungs
Play me a song, Mr. Wolfman Jack
Play it for me in my long Cadillac
Play me that ""Only the Good Die Young""
Take me to the place Tom Dooley was hung
Play ""St. James Infirmary"" in the Court of King James

He noted on Twitter that fans “might find [the song] interesting,” adding:

Stay safe, stay observant and may God be with you.

With a title likely derived from Shakespeare’s 1601 play, Hamlet, the song revolves around the circumstances of President John F. Kennedy’s November 1963 assassination and its ensuing impact on popular culture; making many references to songs, films, musicians, artists, and celebrities who would come to prominence in the years following his death. Considering Dylan’s sophomore album found success the same year as Kennedy’s demise, the song also winds up being a retrospective on many cultural events running parallel to his long career as a songwriter.



At 16 minutes and 55 seconds, it is the longest song in Dylan’s discography to date, surpassing “Highlands” from September 1997’s Time Out Of Mind.","March 27, 2020"

The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
For the times, they are a-changin'38Embed","In the liner notes for his album Biograph, written by Cameron Crowe, Bob Dylan said the following about this song:

This was definitely a song with a purpose. It was influenced of course by the Irish and Scottish ballads …‘Come All Ye Bold Highway Men’, ‘Come All Ye Tender Hearted Maidens’. I wanted to write a big song, with short concise verses that piled up on each other in a hypnotic way. The civil rights movement and the folk music movement were pretty close for a while and allied together at that time. Almost everyone knew everyone else. I had to play this song on the same night that President Kennedy died. Somehow it became a constant opening song and remained that for a long time"".","January 13, 1964"
Bob Dylan,All Along the Watchtower,"All Along the Watchtower Lyrics
""There must be some way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth""

""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late""

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl42Embed","A classic song from Dylan’s John Wesley Harding. The meaning is cryptic; there have been theories of it being about everything from the Vietnam War to Armageddon. Some critics have noted parallels with Isaiah 21:5-9:

5: Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.
6: For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.
7: And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:
8: And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:
9: And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.

Only Mr. Dylan will ever really know.

Jimi Hendrix covered this song, and it led to one of the greatest cover versions of all time. Even Dylan said he was a huge fan.","December 27, 1967"

You used to laugh about

As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes

Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?63Embed","Dylan’s 1965 single “Like a Rolling Stone” is widely considered one of the greatest songs ever recorded. In 2004 the critics at Rolling Stone magazine (whose name was partly Dylan-inspired) named it the #1 song of all time, and it retained its No. 1 position when Rolling Stone re-configured its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2011 and in 2017.

Though radio DJs initially hesitated to play it due to its groundbreaking six-minute length, the song became a smash hit, reaching #2 on the charts behind The Beatles’s “Help!”. Its combination of folk rhythms and electric rock and roll, its anthemic hook, and its defiant yet vulnerable lyrics had a massive impact on the music of the 1960s. Bruce Springsteen spoke for many in his generation when he testified to its influence:

The first time that I heard Bob Dylan I was in the car with my mother, and we were listening to, I think, maybe WMCA, and on came that snare shot that sounded like somebody kicked open the door to your mind, from ‘Like a Rolling Stone.’ And my mother, who was – she was no stiff with rock and roll, she liked the music, she listened – she sat there for a minute, she looked at me, and she said, ‘That guy can’t sing.’ But I knew she was wrong. I sat there, I didn’t say nothin', but I knew that I was listening to the toughest voice that I had ever heard.

While never confirmed by Dylan, many fans have believed that the subject of the song is 60s socialite and Warhol muse, Edie Sedgewick. In what could be considered the first diss song in a tradition that would continue later in hip-hop culture, Dylan tells her tragic story and how she got there.

The official video for the song finally popped out on November 19, 2013.","July 20, 1965"
Bob Dylan,"Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right","Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right Lyrics
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on
But don't think twice, it's all right

And it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right

So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you anymore
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
So long, honey babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say, ""Fare thee well""
I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
You could've done better, but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right27Embed","When Dylan performed “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right” for the first time at the Gaslight Cafe in October 1962, Suze Rotolo – his girlfriend at the time – had already been taking classes at the University of Perugia, Italy, for four months. The acute pain of Dylan’s separation from Rotolo is heard throughout Freewheelin' and, in this song, he seems surprisingly bitter and disillusioned, but still in love with his beautiful girl.



The song’s ubiquitous empathy provides for a subjective listening experience: it is neither optimistic nor pessimistic. As Dylan himself put it: “[It’s] a statement that maybe you can say to make yourself feel better… as if you were talking to yourself.”

The sublime fingerpicking guitar was originally credited to early Dylan backing musician (and Mr Tambourine Man himself) Bruce Langhorne, but Dylan scholar Eyolf Østrem makes a convincing argument that the track is a solo Dylan piece.","May 27, 1963"
Bob Dylan,Make You Feel My Love,"Make You Feel My Love Lyrics
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven’t made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I’ve known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I’d go hungry, I’d go black and blue
I’d go crawling down the avenue
There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn’t do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love10Embed","While “Make You Feel My Love” was originally written by Bob Dylan, the first released recording was actually done by Billy Joel, who put it on his Greatest Hits Volume III.

Bob Seger,Night Moves,"Night Moves Lyrics
I was a little too tall
Could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points hardly renown
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own, sitting way up high
Way up firm and high

Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues

Workin' on our night moves
Trying' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves
In the summertime (Mmm)
In the sweet summertime

We weren't in love, oh no far from it
We weren't searchin’ for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Living by the sword
And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, to the alley, or the trusty woods
I used her, she used me
But neither one cared
We were getting our share
Workin' on our night moves
Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
Mmm, and it was summertime
Mmm, sweet summertime, summertime
And oh the wonder
Felt the lightning
Yeah, and we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closing in

Per Bob Seger from his website about the biographical song’s theme –

It still has the exact meaning it’s always had for me — the freedom and looseness I had during high school. That romance actually took place after high school, and it actually was about a real person. Her boyfriend was in the service, and when he came back she married him. My first broken heart.

(In a 1994 Detroit Free Press interview).



It was the feature song on an album with the same name. While the album cover gives credit to his Silver Bullet Band, the song was recorded in Toronto with different musicians, both Canadians and Americans.

It had a huge success and won a huge acclaim by critics and fans, winning Platinum status (x6).","December 12, 1976"
Bob Seger,Against the Wind,"Against the Wind Lyrics
Seems like yesterday
But it was long ago
Janey was lovely
She was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness
With the radio playin' low, and
And the secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn
And nothing left to prove

And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me, oh-so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
We were running against the wind

And the years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home and I
I guess I lost my way
There were oh-so many roads
I was livin' to run
And runnin' to live
Never worried about payin'
Or even how much I owed
Movin' eight miles a minute
For months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

Against the wind
Little somethin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind


Well, those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about

What to leave in
What to leave out

He did not have time to re-record it with his Silver Bullet Band, so after rewriting the verses, Seger simply sang over the demo, had Alto Reed play the sax solo and called it done. His manager suggested asking for writing credits after rewriting the verses, but Seger declined – feeling “nobody’s gonna like it” (a decision he would later regret).

Soon after, the band toured Europe. Occasionally Seger would ask the band to perform the song and they’d resist, then complain afterwards. But crowds responded well to the song, so “Old Time Rock And Roll” was released as the album’s fourth single in the spring of 1979 and became its fourth top 30 hit in a row in the US.

In 1983, “Old Time Rock And Roll” was included in an iconic scene in the film Risky Business where Joel Goodson (played by Tom Cruise) cranks up the stereo and rocks out in his underwear after his parents leave him home alone. The song became popular again, re-charting at #48 that October.","March 1, 1979"

Bob Seger,Like a Rock,"Like a Rock Lyrics
Stood there boldly
Sweatin' in the sun
Felt like a million
Felt like number one
The height of summer
I'd never felt that strong
Like a rock

I was eighteen
Didn't have a care
Working for peanuts
Not a dime to spare
But I was lean and
Solid everywhere
Like a rock

My hands were steady
My eyes were clear and bright
My walk had purpose
My steps were quick and light
And I held firmly
To what I felt was right
Like a rock
Like a rock—I was strong as I could be
Like a rock—nothin' ever got to me
Like a rock—I was something to see
Like a rock

And I stood arrow straight
Unencumbered by the weight
Of all these hustlers and their schemes
I stood proud—I stood tall
High above it all
I still believed in my dreams

Twenty years now
Where'd they go?
Twenty years
I don't know
I sit and I wonder sometimes
Where they've gone

And sometimes late at night
Oh, when I'm bathed in the firelight
The moon comes callin' a ghostly white
And I recall
I recall
Like a rock—standin' arrow straight
Like a rock—chargin' from the gate
Like a rock—carryin' the weight
Like a rock
Oh like a rock—the sun upon my skin
Like a rock—hard against the wind
Like a rock—I see myself again
Like a rock—oh like a rock1Embed","The title track from Bob Seger’s 1986 album has the hearty nostalgic appeal of a number of Mr. Seger’s earlier hits that look back longingly at youth.

This song’s greatest exposure was in Chevrolet truck television advertisements from 1991 until 2004, for their massively successful “Like a Rock” campaign, which was also one of their longest-running ad campaigns. The song would help sell millions of trucks over the years, and is still widely associated with Chevrolet today.

Bob Seger,Hollywood Nights,"Hollywood Nights Lyrics

She stood there bright as the sun on that California coast
He was a Midwestern boy on his own
She looked at him with those soft eyes, so innocent and blue
He knew right then he was too far from home
Oh, he was too far from home

She took his hand and she led him along that golden beach
They watched the waves tumble over the sand
They drove for miles and miles up those twisting, turning roads
Higher and higher and higher they climbed

And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills

He'd headed west 'cause he felt that a change would do him good
See some old friends, good for the soul
She had been born with a face that would let her get her way
He saw that face and he lost all control
Yeah, he had lost all control

Night after night, day after day, it went on and on
Then came that morning he woke up alone
He spent all night staring down at the lights of LA
Wondering if he could ever go home

And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
It was looking so right
It was giving him chills
In those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
With a passion that kills
In those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills

“‘Hollywood Nights.’ I think Don Brewer (his drummer) would agree with me. It’s just a train. He plays it great and we really look forward to that every night”

Once upon a time, not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love

She says, ""We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot""

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
""Baby, it's okay
Someday""
We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love

Regarding the track’s lyrical content, Jon Bon Jovi gave the following statement:

It deals with the way that two kids–Tommy and Gina–face life’s struggles, and how their love and ambitions get them through the hard times. It’s working class and it’s real… I wanted to incorporate the movie element, and tell a story about people I knew. So instead of doing what I did on ‘Runaway’, where the girl didn’t have a name, I gave them names, which gave them an identity… Tommy and Gina aren’t two specific people; they represent a lifestyle.

The hit unexpectedly re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 on November 21, 2013 in the 25th spot. It re-entered the charts after a 2009 video of Boston Celtics basketball fan Jeremy Fry dancing to the rock anthem at Boston’s TD Garden was re-uploaded to YouTube. With 11 million new views, the video propelled the 1987 classic back on the charts.","October 31, 1986"

An anthem beloved by the fans, it popularized the phrase “it’s my life”, as Jon Bon Jovi would later state:

I thought I was writing very self-indulgently about my own life and where I was in it. I didn’t realize that the phrase ‘It’s My Life’ would be taken as being about everyone – by teenagers, by older guys, mechanics, whatever. ‘It’s my life, and I’m taking control.’ Everyone kind of feels that way from time to time.

Bon Jovi,Always,"Always Lyrics
This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
To say to you 'till the end of time
Yeah, I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind

This song was originally meant to be the soundtrack for the 1993 film “Romeo Is Bleeding”, but the band decided not lend the song for the movie after having some distaste. Although the movie failed, Always left a high record on the international music chart, topping 5 of those.

This song seems to be influenced from “Romeo and Juliet” by Dire Straits and “Romeo Is Bleeding” by Tom Waits.","October 11, 1994"

'Cause a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist, I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true

But I laughed so hard I think I died
Ooh yeah

While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend

The song, written by Mike Reid and Allen Shamblin, sat on the Billboard Hot 100 for 20 weeks, peaking at No. 18. The words are sung from the perspective of someone experiencing unrequited, one-sided love, and it has inspired heartbreaking covers by Adele, Bon Iver, George Michael, Prince, and many others.

According to co-songwriter Mike Reid, the idea for the song came to him after he read an article in a Nashville newspaper about a man on trial for shooting up his girlfriend’s car while he was drunk. The judge asked why he had done it, and the man responded with, “I learned, Your Honor, that you can’t make a woman love you if she don’t.” The phrase stuck with Reid and ended up serving as the inspiration for the song’s chorus.","October 22, 1991"

Holstein suggested writing a song about old people, building on a previous Prine work called “Old Folks” at the time (later changed to “Hello In There.”) Prine balked at Holstein’s suggestion, saying

I said, ‘I can’t do that, because I put everything I felt about old people into that one song. How about a woman who’s middle-aged but feels older than she is?’ And he says, ‘Nah.’ So I went home and wrote ‘Angel from Montgomery’ by myself.""



In John Prine: In Spite of Himself, writer Eddie Huffman calls “Angel from Montgomery” a cross between a Thoreau observation that “the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation” and Glen Campbell’s “Dreams of the Everyday Housewife.”",1974

And she calls me on the phone
Sees babies everywhere she goes
And she wants one of her own
She's waited long enough she says
And still he can't decide
Pretty soon she'll have to choose
And it tears her up inside

She is scared
Scared to run out of time

I see my folks are getting on
And I watch their bodies change
I know they see the same in me

When they're staring back at you

Scared you'll run out of time
When did the choices get so hard
With so much more at stake
Life gets mighty precious
When there's less of it to waste

Mmmmmmm, scared you'll run out of time

Just when I thought I'd had enough
And all my tears were shed
No promise left unbroken
There were no painful words unsaid

I could leave it all behind
You opened up my heart again
And then much to my surprise

Down a long dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see
Through the dark there's a light
If you knew how much this moment
Means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
If you knew how happy you are making me
I never thought I'd love anyone so much
Feels like home to me

Randy Newman’s Faust is a 1995 musical based on the classic story of Faust, but updated to modern day, and it’s full of Newman’s cynicism.

“Feels Like Home” is a complete contradiction to the rest of the music in the work;  it’s a heartfelt, sweet love song.",1995
Bonnie Raitt,Thank You,"Thank You LyricsSittin' here thinking, baby, about you
I'm wonderin' how I ever got through my life without you
Days passed me by and left my life somewhere behind
Games I was trying left me old before my time
You came into my life almost like you knew
The time was running out I came running home with you
You taught me how to love you
You helped me to believe
You could even love me
I was all you'd ever need
Sometimes when you're sleepin'
I wonder if its true
I'm afraid they'll come and take away this precious dream with you
Then you wake and hold me and love me through the night
Then I'll know that somehow everything will be alright
Thank you baby, for giving me my life

Wishing you were here by me to end this misery
And I wonder, I wo wo wo wo wonder
Why, you ran away
And I wonder where you will stay

Is missing tonight
Seems she ran aground on manoeuvres
One of our submarines

A hungry heart
To regulate their breathing

A Baltic moon
Along the northern seaboard
And down below
The Winter Boys are waiting for the storm

And I can trace my history
Down a generation to my home
In one of our submarines

Air valves hissing open
Half her pressure blown away
Flounder in the ocean
See the Winter Boys drinking heavy water from a stone

Tired illusion drown in the night

Down the beaches, hand in hand

Oh my country, Europa
I'll stand beside you in the rain, Europa

Who'd I see on the cover of a magazine?

Buy her singles and see all her films
Paste her pictures on my windowsill
But that's not quite the same - it isn't, is it?

I'll walk beside you in the rain, Europa

She was back in London
Pushed past the papermen
Calling her name
She smiled for the cameras
As a bodyguard grabbed me
Her eyes were gone forever as they drove her away

I'm sensitive about my height
I will look around and say
Hmm, I thought I was immune
All my life I have waited
To be given any word
It was screaming to be heard
Please remember
The Earth can be any shape you want it
Any shape at all
Dark and cold or bright and warm
Long or thin or small
But it's home and all I ever had
And maybe why for me the Earth is flat
Turn the island to the storm tonight
Who turned it?
Then when they spill the demon seed
Turn and face into the wind
All along you still believed
Believed you were immune
And if love is all you're missing
Look into your heart
Is anybody home?
Please remember
The Earth can be any shape you want it
Any in the world
But don't you point that ray gun at me
I might just explode
There are stones buried in your soul
And only a fool would blame the death of rock and roll
And in time you'll come to understand

My friends say she's a dumb blonde but they don't know she dyes her hair
She thinks the fighting in Central America's easily solved
But what to wear to Bel Air premieres is a problem she could never resolve

She's an airhead

She's an airhead
Thousands in trust, cusp aquarius, get serious
She's an airhead
Tinted contacts don't change the fact that black is black
She's an airhead
And while I'm impressed with the length of those legs
She's not an intellectual giant
She'd like to model, or maybe act, or start a magazine
Before she signs any big contracts, she better learn to read
But in her dreams she's the queen of the fashion regime
You ask me do I love you, does the Pope live in the woods? Quod

And while I'm impressed with the size of that chest
She's not an intellectual giant
Sweet and low and oh-so, little Ms. Dora Jarre
Safe sex and fishnets and could you walk me to my car, pa
She's losing faith in a world that is out of control
So she's gonna nix politics, she's taking up volleyball
Volleyball, why?
Cause she's an airhead

In tiny patterns
On my antenna
And the five o'clock show, 'Allo, 'Allo
Brooklyn is crawling with famous people
I turn my vehicle beneath the river, west from south
Through the airwaves
People never read the airwaves
Do we only feed the airwaves
I really should have seen through the airwaves
Electric fences line our new freeway
Here in the half-light, the motor homes leave
Knee-deep in water under a pylon
How slow my heartbeat
How thin the air I'm breathing in
Through the airwaves
People never read the airwaves
Do we only feed the airwaves
Or stamp them out at street level?
Airwaves, the dampness of the wind
The airwaves, the tension of the skin

Control has enabled the abandoned wires again
But the copper cables all rust in the acid rain
That flood the subway with elements of our corrosion
Cabled in to me, yeah, cable them to me
Cable them to me
Be in my broadcast when this is over
Give me your shoulder
I need a place to wait for morning
No it was nothing, some car backfiring
Please don't ask questions
I itch all over
Let me sleep
Through the airwaves

Or stamp them out at street level?

And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye?

Still I can't let go

You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, mmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

Will you love me again like you loved me before?

And just ran out with that other fella

You just don't understand how much I love you, do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat all night (Baby, I'm here for you, baby)
Just like you did, baby, but that's alrright
Heh, I love you anyway (Baby, you tried)
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'til my dying day, baby

The song alludes to Cooley High, a 1975 film about two Black high school students in Chicago who are about to graduate from high school. There is a scene that plays the G.C. Cameron version of the song when Preach visits Cochise’s grave during the ceremony of his death. The movie is considered a classic in Black cinema, and it even inspired Boyz II Men to entitle their album Cooleyhighharmony.

FUN FACT: The vocal group sang this A Capella track during their days at Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts, which correlates well with the aforementioned references.

  


The song has a lot of historical context before the 90’s, but it was Boyz II Men who popularized it in mainstream media. It got a lot of radio airplay, peaking at #2 on Billboard’s Top 100 and becoming a #1 hit on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop singles list. It also appeared in a few films, most notably in Lethal Weapon 3.","August 20, 1991"

Well, maybe that's a pain we can't hide
Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other?
Why do we push love away?

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby
Some people will work things out
And some just don't know how to change

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it, baby14Embed",?,"April 11, 1995"

Motownphilly back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

It's long overdue but now
Philly is slammin'
Boyz II Men, ABC, BBD
The east coast family
Never skipped a beat (nah)
While cooling on South street
Jet black Benz, plenty of friends
And all the Philly steaks you can eat

Back in school
We used to dream about this every day
Could it really happen?
Or do dreams just fade away?
Then we started singing and
They said it sounds smooth
And we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you
Motownphilly back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

Yo, these four new jacks is real
Smooth on the harmony tip
Nate, Mike, Shawn, and Wan
You know the mentality
Keep flippin' the gift

The spotlight is on us now, watch us do this
Da da, daaa da da, da da da da da da
Live and direct from Phillytown
Rap and hype and we can get down
We are ready to roll
So now the world will know that we were

Back in school we used to dream about this everyday
Could it really happen? Or do dreams fade away?
Then we started singing, and they said it sounds smooth
So we started a group and here we are kickin' it just for you, oh, oh

Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men
Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men
Then we started singing them
They said it sounded smooth

Now check this out, one day back in Philly
Four guys wanted to sing
They came up to me, I said, ""Well, what's your name?
(Boyz II Men!) Hey, you know what I'm sayin'?""
Then I said, ""Alright fellas
Well, let me see what you can do""
And then, a smile when that Wanya said
""Yo Mike, check this out, see if this one moves you""

Tick tock, I'm on the clock and I'm feeling like
This job's just 9 to 5'ing my life away
It's like I'm back in school and I'm in the last class
And I'm passing time until the bell ring
Having visions of summertime
Wait a minute now, that's just later tonight
Tan legs and tailgating, it's all up in the moonlight
And by the way, it's pay day

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
Double up and it's bound to get buck wild
Hey ladies, let your hair down
We know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah
Just do your thing like it's spring break
Wake and bake and we at it again
We live it up for the weekend

Backwoods looking like Panama City
A bunch of jacked up trucks and bikinis
Got a Yeti full of good ideas

The track peaked at #64 on the Billboard Hot 100, and #7 on the Billboard Country Airplay Charts. The track was also certified RIAA Gold, meaning it has sold over 500,000 units.

Gilbert described the inspiration for the track to iHeartRadio:

“We were rolling through the Midwest, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Minnesota, and you see how hard people work and how much they need to let it go when they get to Friday. All those people coming out to the shows and rocking hard; they meant business. I wanted to write a song that matched that intensity to kick back even harder than you work. That’s where ‘The Weekend’ comes from: all those people who came out and threw it down with us.”

The track was written entirely over the phone with songwriter Andrew DeRoberts.","July 22, 2016"

Old boy done put his hands on a woman

Ass whooping in the parking lot
About to drop this fool right in front of the cops

I'm proud of what I done

Yeah read me my rights, put me in cuffs
Take me downtown, Barney lock me up

I’ll tell the judge that I'd do it again

Said his wife and his kids was in the house
Some old boy broke in, man it all went south
When he dropped the hammer on his forty five
Now he's in the pen; twenty-five to life

Well, I'd have said
Read me my rights, put me in cuffs

The song as a whole is a protest against law enforcement and what they deem to be right and wrong. Both cases mentioned in the song involve someone fighting to defend themself, and/or others from an evil force, and both cases end with the defender getting punished. Brantley has used this song to open up about his firm belief in the Second Amendment and his stance on what law enforcement should say is right and wrong.","May 19, 2014"

Brantley Gilbert,Fire & Brimstone,"Fire & Brimstone Lyrics
I'm feelin' last night this mornin'
A  train wreck pain in my head
But  when I reach for the hair of the dog in the drawer
Found a dusty old Bible instead
Thought I ain't been to service since my granddaddy passed
Finish  my cigarette out there on the front steps
And  then slipped in the back by myself

You bring on the fire and brimstone
Tell  me I'm goin' to hell
Yeah, which one of you will throw the first stone?
I guess I'll see you there
You bring on the fire

And  then I heard the reverend
He said, ""Turn and shake your neighbor's hand""
One by one saw them all turn around just to stare back at me
Like the wretch that I am

You bring on the fire and brimstone
Tell me I'm goin' to hell
Yeah, which one of you will throw the first stone?
I guess I'll see you there
You bring on the fire
You bring on the fire
Bring it on
Out of spite I went down to the altar
And almost all of them followed me there
It turns out there's only one book and one cover (One cover)
And they're all just glad I was there

And we prayed for grace and forgiveness
About faith, hope, and love
And when I make my way to Heaven
Oh, I pray he'll say ""well done""

You bring on the fire and brimstone
Tell me I'm goin' to hell
I know he died and rolled away the stone
I guess I'll see him there
You bring on the fire

Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
You bring it on

There's a chance that when I get to Heaven
Oh, He may not know me at all
If that's the case, man, then I'll take my judgement
Oh, but it won't be from y'all, no
You bring on the fire
You bring on the fire
Bring it on, bring it on, bring on the fireEmbed","This song is narrated by a person who is a hell-raiser and has lost their faith. In the song, the narrator stumbles upon a Bible and decides to go back to church. Two types of judgment that the narrator sees are described: the judgment from the other people in the church, and the judgment the narrator will face in the afterlife. This song serves as the title track to Gilbert’s 5th studio album.","October 4, 2019"

Brian Eno,By This River,"By This River Lyrics
Here we are
Stuck by this river
You and I
Underneath a sky that's ever falling down, down, down
Ever falling down

Through the day
As if on an ocean
Waiting here
Always failing to remember why we came, came, came
I wonder why we came


You talk to me
As if from a distance
And I reply
With impressions chosen from another time, time, time
From another time

Brian Eno,Baby’s on Fire,"Baby’s on Fire LyricsBaby's on fire
Better throw her in the water
Look at her laughing
Like a heifer to the slaughter
Baby's on fire
And all the laughing boys are bitching
Waiting for photos
Oh the plot is so bewitching
Rescuers row, row
Do your best to change the subject
Blow the wind blow, blow
Lend some assistance to the object
Photographers snip snap
Take your time, she's only burning
This kind of experience
Is necessary for her learning
If you'll be my flotsam
I could be half the man I used to
They said, ""You were hot stuff
And that's what baby's been reduced to""

Juanita and Juan
Very clever with maracas
Makin' their fortunes
Selling second-hand tobaccos
Juan dances at Chico's
And when the clients are evicted
He empties the ashtrays
And pockets all that he's collected
But baby's on fire
And all the instruments agree that
Her temperature's rising
But any idiot would know that3Embed","“Baby’s on Fire” is the third track on Brian Eno’s debut solo album. Recorded in Majestic Studios, London, in September 1973, with the participation of Robert Fripp, who played 3 minute guitar solo.

Eno performed song in the live album, “June 1, 1974” with Kevin Ayers, John Cale, Ollie Halsall and Eddie Sparrow. About the performance, Eno said:

The instruments were incredibly out of tune, so out of tune you wouldn’t believe it. But it sounds fantastic. There’s one little bit in it where there’s a riff between the guitar and one of the bassists, and they’re so out of tune it sounds like cellos. Amazing! I mean if you tried to make that sound in the studio it would have taken you ages. You wouldn’t have thought of making it, in fact, it’s such a bizarre sound. And the piano and guitar are quite well out of tune as well. Ha!

“Baby’s on Fire” was also performed in the 1998 film “Velvet Goldmine”, with vocals by the film’s star, Jonathan Rhys Meyers.",January 1974

I'll find a place somewhere in the corner
I'm gonna waste the rest of my days

Just waiting, seasons change, some day, oh-oh
My dreams will pull you through that garden gate

I want to be the wandering sailor
We're silhouettes by the light of the moon
I sit playing solitaire by the window
Just waiting, seasons change, ah-hah
You'll see one day these dreams will pull you through my door

Brian Eno,St. Elmo’s Fire,"St. Elmo’s Fire Lyrics
Brown Eyes and I were tired
We had walked and we had scrambled
Through the moors and through the briars
Through the endless blue meanders

In the blue August moon
In the cool August moon

Over the nights and through the fires
We went surging down the wires
Through the towns and on the highways
Through the storms in all their thundering

In the blue August moon
In the cool August moon

Then we rested in a desert
Where the bones were white as teeth, sir
And we saw St. Elmo's Fire
Splitting ions in the ether

In the blue August moon
In the cool August moon
In the cool August moon
In the cool August moon4Embed","…on ‘St. Elmo’s Fire’ I had this idea and said to Fripp, ‘Do you know what a Wimshurst machine is?’ It’s a device for generating very high voltages which then leap between the two poles, and it has a certain erratic contour, and I said, ‘You have to imagine a guitar line that has that, very fast and unpredictable.’ And he played that part which to me was very Wimshurst indeed.

Eno has stated that the term refers to the guitars: “The title Warm Jets came from the guitar sound on the track of that name, which I described on the track sheet as ‘warm jet guitar’, because it sounded like a tuned jet.”  However, there are rumors that it has a more sexual meaning – that is, that it refers to a “golden shower”, especially since the cover art includes a playing card with a picture of a woman urinating on it.",January 1974

Is flicking dimly up on the screen
I can't see the lines

Perhaps my brains have turned to sand

Oh me, oh my

You'd be surprised
At my degree of uncertainty
How can moments go so slow?

Several times
I've seen the evening slide away
Watching the signs
Taking over from the fading day
Perhaps my brains are old and scrambled


Several times

I've seen the evening slide away
While watching the signs
(Who would believe what an innocent voice could do?)
Taking over from the fading day
Changing water into wine
(Never a silence; always a face at the door)
Several times
(Who would believe what a poor set of ears can tell you?)

Watching the signs

All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind
In the garden, I see, west purple shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green
Pretty music, I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh

On January 3, 1982, Bruce recorded the demos that would become the Nebraska album. Born In the U.S.A. was downbeat and somber – a straightforward fit sonically for the song’s sad story.

On April 27, 1982, Springsteen and the E Street Band recorded the hard-rocking version that was released in 1984, infused with a sense of bitter sarcasm that’s at the center of what makes it such a classic. It was internationally successful, reaching the top 20 in nine countries including the US and the UK. It’s is Springsteen’s highest-charting single in the US, peaking at #2.","June 4, 1984"
Bruce Springsteen,Born to Run,"Born to Run LyricsIn the day, we sweat it out on the streets
Of a runaway American dream
At night, we ride through mansions of glory
In suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Yes, girl, we were
Wendy let me in, I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild, babe
I want to know if love is real
Oh, can you show me?

Beyond the palace, hemi-powered drones
Scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss
(1, 2, 3, 4) The highways jammed with broken heroes
On a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday girl, I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really want to go, and we'll walk in the sun
But till then, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run
Oh honey, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run
Come on with me, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run15Embed","Written at 7½ West End Court in Long Branch, New Jersey in early 1974, the song was Bruce Springsteen’s last-ditch effort to make it big. The prior year, Springsteen had released two albums to critical acclaim but with little commercial success. The lyrics to the song are appropriately epic for his last-ditch, all-or-nothing shot at the stars, yet they remain rooted in the universal desperation of adolescence: Will you walk with me out on the wire, cause baby I’m just a scared and lonely rider…We gotta get out while we’re young, ‘cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run.’

Written in the first person, the song is a love letter to a girl named Wendy (Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend I wanna guard your dreams and visions…; I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight/in an everlasting kiss!), for whom the hot-rod-riding protagonist certainly has enough passion to love, but perhaps not the patience. However, Springsteen has noted that it has a much simpler core: getting out of Freehold.

The final mix was notoriously hard to make, having 72 tracks (instruments), including drums, guitars, piano, bass, and percussion.

On Jan 14, 2014, Jimmy Fallon on NBC’s late night did a parody on Governor Christie’s Bridgegate, joined by his (Christie’s) favorite singer – The Boss – The lyrics to the parody version can be found here","August 25, 1975"
Bruce Springsteen,Dancing in the Dark,"Dancing in the Dark Lyrics
I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there, baby
I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Messages keep getting clearer
Radio's on, and I'm moving 'round my place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere, and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say, ""You gotta stay hungry""
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting around here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, give me just one look

You can't start a fire
Sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

25Embed","The first single off of Springsteen’s seminal album Born In The U.S.A., this track was written two years after most of the other songs on the album.

Producer Jon Landau thought the new album lacked a guaranteed hit and pushed Springsteen to draft one more song. The two men got into a brief altercation, after which Bruce wrote “Dancing in the Dark” about his ‘difficulty writing a hit single and his frustration trying to write songs that will please people’.

Its music video contains an early appearance by actress Courtney Cox. It also helped introduce Springsteen to a younger audience, setting the stage for a seven-single run of top 10 hits from the album.

“Dancing In The Dark” became Springsteen’s highest charting single the Boss has ever had, spending four weeks in the #2 position of the Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of 1984, held from the top spot by Duran Duran “The Reflex” and Prince “When Doves Cry”. It also spent six weeks at #1 on the Mainstream Rock chart.

This single is also Springsteen’s only to be certified platinum.","May 3, 1984"

The song is one of several songs recorded in 1982 that did not end up on his Nebraska album, released late that year.

Its music video is the first one Springsteen had a strictly acting role, not involving footage of a live performance. It won ‘Best Male Video’ at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards.

Bruce Springsteen,Thunder Road,"Thunder Road LyricsThe screen door slams, Mary's dress sways
Like a vision, she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me, and I want you only
Don't turn me home again
I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside
Darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared, and you're thinking
That maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty, but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me
You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a saviour to rise from these streets
Well now, I'm no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well the night's busting open
These two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the tracks
Oh-oh come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh-oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh, Thunder Road, sit tight, take hold
Thunder Road
Well I got this guitar, and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride it ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken
There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road
In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines roaring on
But when you get to the porch they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers
And I'm pulling out of here to win32Embed","Perhaps the quintessential Bruce number, this anthemic 1975 song contains many of the lyrical and musical hallmarks that make the band from E Street so justly famous. It is the first song on the first side of Springsteen’s breakthrough album, Born to Run.

Born to Run was the final installment of Springsteen’s first record deal with Columbia. The preceding albums, Greetings from Asbury Park and The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle, had not been commercial successes. The third album would be critical in determining the viability of his future in music. Facing that do-or-die pressure to compose a life-defining last-ditch effort, he leads off with a song about life-defining last-ditch efforts.

In his 2005 VH1 Storytellers interview, Springsteen shares that Thunder Road is more than an invitation to the album, it’s an invitation to a bigger life. In his own words, “The music sounds like an invitation. Something is opening up to you… What I hoped it would be when I wrote this song is what I got out of rock and roll music – which is a sense of a larger life, greater experience, hopefully more and better sex, a sense of fun – more fun, a sense of personal exploration, your possibilities… the idea that it is all lying somewhere inside of you… just on the edge of town.”

Another song on Born to Run that took almost a year to complete. In February-March 1975, it was performed live as “Wings For Wheels”. In late March, Bruce decided to take the music from another song, “Walking In the Street”, and use it to replace the instrumental outro (ending) of the song. He also revised the lyrics, renaming it “Thunder Road”, based on a poster he had seen in a movie theater lobby. Thunder Road was first recorded at the Record Plant, NY on April 18, 1975, and it was finished on July 16, 1975.","August 25, 1975"
Bruce Springsteen,The River,"The River Lyrics
I come from down in the valley
Where, mister, when you're young
They bring you up to do
Like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school
When she was just seventeen
We'd drive out of this valley
Down to where the fields were green

We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we'd ride

Then I got Mary pregnant
And, man, that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday
I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
No flowers, no wedding dress

That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we did ride
Ah-yah
I got a job working construction
For the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work
On account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well, mister, they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember
And Mary acts like she don't care

But I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night, on them banks, I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true?
Or is it something worse?

That sends me down to the river
Though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight
Ah-yah-yah
Down to the river
My baby and I
Oh, down to the river we ride
Ah-yah-ay
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh

Rolling Stone describes the song as:

…filled with an uncommon common sense and intelligence that could only have come from an exceptionally warmhearted but wary graduate of the street of hard knocks.",May 1981
Bruce Springsteen,Blinded by the Light,"Blinded by the Light Lyrics
Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder feelin' kinda older I tripped the
Merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing the calliope
Crashed to the ground

Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot snappin' his fingers clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers daddy's within earshot save the buckshot turn up the band

And she was blinded by the light
Oh, cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright

Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the east
He says, ""Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least""
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance
Yeah, he was blinded by the light
Oh, cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
He got down but she never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight

Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes
She said I'll turn you on sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
And go-cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
And little Early-Pearly came in by her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride

Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer playin' backyard bombardier
Yes and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card
He said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground
Asked him which was the way back home
He said take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then boy, you're on your own

And now in Zanzibar a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw
A gap but figured he'd be all right
He was just blinded by the light
Cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun
Woah, but but mama that's where the fun is

I was blinded
Oh mama, oh mama

I was blinded
I was blinded
I was blinded by the light

Bruce has talked about the song many times before, stating many of the references in the song are personal, including people he knew or had met on the Boardwalks, or had grown up around, or were just direct personal references to himself.

This was also Springsteen’s first single. It was released only in the US, where it didn’t see much sucess. Although, the band Manfred Mann’s Earth Band recorded a cover for the song in 1976, becoming the only Springsteen song to reach #1.","January 5, 1973"

I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far

Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
I spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever
Forever, no

While “Summer of '69” does tell a story of a young man, potentially set in 1969, it was actually written about “making love in the summertime”, hence using the number “69” as a reference to sex.

The song was an international hit, reaching its highest peaks in the Netherlands (#4) and the US (#5), and remains of Adams' most popular songs internationally.

Singer Ryan Adams shared he “had to go into therapy” over the humiliation he’d suffered over several years of people confusing him with Bryan Adams and requesting this song at his concerts. Famously in 2002, a heckler shouted through seven straight songs requesting it, prompting Ryan to hand the man $40 and ask him to leave.","June 17, 1985"

Written by Adams and his songwriting partner Jim Vallance, “Heaven” is a power ballad about a love between two people that was heavily inspired by Journey’s Faithfully, made in the previous year, and even features that band’s drummer at the time, Steve Smith. It almost didn’t make it to the album, for both Adams and producer Jimmy Iovine felt that it didn’t really fit in an album filled with harder rock songs. However, for reasons yet unknown, Adams changed his mind at the last minute and kept it in anyway.

The rest is history, for “Heaven” became Bryan Adams' first #1 single and one of the most well-known singles in his entire discography.","April 9, 1985"

Although the general tone of the book reflected Hall’s carefree and cheerful persona, it featured a not very flattering portrayal of Bryan Ferry. The man himself avoided talking about the book to the media, but confessed that he found the idea of tell-all books ‘disturbing’ and later claimed that Hall was ‘addicted to publicity’.","November 2, 1987"
Bryan Ferry,These Foolish Things,"These Foolish Things Lyrics
Oh will you never let me be?
Oh will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us, are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

And still my heart has wings
These foolish things
Remind me of you

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant

A fairground's painted swings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I somehow knew that this had to be

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawberries only seven francs a kilo

And still my heart has wings
These foolish things
Remind me of you

The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The pier d'France with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is spring
These foolish things
Remind me of you

I know, that this, was bound to be
These things have haunted me
For you've entirely enchanted me

The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside, dance invitations

Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you

First daffodils, and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables

And still my heart has wings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes

The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things
Remind me of you

How strange, how sweet, to find you still
These things are dear to me
That seem to bring you so near to me

The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you

Just youEmbed",?,"October 5, 1973"

Trying to find certainty
He needs all the world to confirm

Johnny thinks the world would be right
If it could buy truth from him
Mary says he changes his mind
More than a woman
But she made her bed

Johnny says he's willing to learn
When he decides he's a fool
Johnny says he'll live anywhere

Says she should be used to it

She never knows what to think
She says that he still acts like he's
Being discovered
Scared that he'll be caught
Without a second thought

Johnny feels he's wasting his breath
Trying to talk sense to her
Mary says he's lacking a real
Sense of proportion

In the evening of your years
No other love could stem the tide

Open your heart and let me live

They bow down to you whenever you pass
In a world of fading sadness
An emerald ring, a photograph
That look in your eyes the brush of your cheek
These are the moments in life that I seek
No reason or rhyme, no presence of mind
Just a dance to the music of time
Why must you shed such tender tears
In the evening of your years
No other love could stem the tide
Of the loneliness I hide
Inside out, upside down
Obscured by clouds, or underground

Wherever you are, whenever you speak

It's smooth and it goes down really nice
Costs two hundred dollars a bottle and that's a damn good bargain price

Now reefer make me mellow and whiskey make me wild
Get a couple of glasses and let's get drunk in style
I'm talkin' about Cognac; careful now, it sneaks up on you strong
If the late Muddy Waters was here drinkin' with us that bottle would be ten times gone

(Good and smooth, good and smooth)
(It goes good with the blues)
(Come on Keith, help yourself)

(Come on in here, Beck)

Let met tell you 'bout this woman
When she'd get tight
Give her a double shot of Rémy Martin XO
It'll launch her rocket right
Talkin' 'bout cognac (XO cognac, that is)
And it goes right to your head
(Yes it do, how well do I know)

And it'll damn sure raise the dead

This is perhaps the most iconic of Holly songs, because it was his first hit and given its seeming prediction. Holly was killed shorty after marrying Maria Santiago. She suffered a miscarriage soon after his death, making him one of a kind.

The song was originally going to be titled “Cindy Lou”, named after Holly’s baby niece Cindy and his sister Patricia Lou, but Crickets drummer Jerry Allison asked Holly to change the name to impress his then-girlfriend Peggy Sue Gerron.

Holly obliged, but when the recording engineer threatened to change the song back to “Cindy Lou” if Allison didn’t stop making mistakes, he took a few moments to go through a drumming exercise. Holly liked the feel of Allison' drum exercise, changed his guitar licks to better fit with it, and that became the new beat for the song.

Allison married Gerron in 1958. They divorced in 1965.

The song’s legacy includes Rolling Stone naming it the #197 Greatest Song Of All Time, NPR naming it one of the “100 Most Important American Musical Works of the 20th Century” and The Rock ‘n Roll Hall of Fame honoring it as “one of the most popular and influential Rock classics.”

A sequel to the song was written titled “Peggy Sue Got Married”. It was released five months after Holly’s death.","March 1, 1958"

In this song, Buddy seeks to express his extreme enthusiasm for the crazy feelings he has for a girl, and how they make him want her.

Burning Spear,Slavery Days,"Slavery Days LyricsDo you remember the days of slavery?
Do you remember the days of slavery?
And how they beat us
And how they worked us so hard
And they used us
'Til they refuse us
Do you remember the days of slavery?
And a big fat bull
We usually pull it everywhere
We must pull it
With shackles around our necks
And I can see it all no more
Do you remember the days of slavery?
My brother feels it
Including my sisters too
Some of us survive
Showing them that we are still alive
Do you remember the days of slavery?
History can recall, history can recall
History can recall the days of slavery
Oh slavery days!
Oh slavery days!
While I remember, please remember
Do you do you do you, do you do you do you
Oh slavery days!
Oh slavery days!Embed","During 400 years, since the Portuguese, in the 16th century, first engage the Atlantic slavery trade, about 12 millions of Africans were forced to move to America.
In those slavery days, as Burning Spear put it, their memory of this diaspora was lost. Later, after the abolition of slavery, their memory of the slavery itself was also lost.
As can be seen in this song, the Rastafari movement, influenced by its “prophet” Marcus Garvey, was conscious of the African and slavery roots of the Jamaican people.",1975

Recorded live while filming a scene from the movie Rockers. Director Theodoros Bafaloukos describes the scene: “Seven seven seventy-seven, July 7, 1977, Burning Spear on the beach in St. Ann’s Bay, the birthplace of Marcus Garvey. This was a day of reckoning for many Rastas. A day pregnant with expectations. A Marcus Garvey prophesy. ‘When the Two Sevens Clash There Will Be Dread,’ as Culture declared in their song of that same name. […] By the time dusk hit, we had shot a scene with Horsemouth in Burning Spear’s yard. Then, by seven o’clock, we moved to the beach. And here, on a ruined arch of a 16th century Spanish jail, Burning Spear sat and started to sing a cappella ‘Jah No Dead.’ A huge crowd had gathered to watch, but not a voice was heard, not a twig cracked under anyone’s foot. A yellow moon was rising, and I was feeling fine.”",

Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give
Or are we meant to be kind?
And if only fools are kind, Alfie
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie
What will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie
I know there's something much more
Something even non-believers can believe in
I believe in love, Alfie

Faster than a heat seeking missile on a mission
Faster than a bass to a hook when daddy's fishing
Faster than a walnut rolls off a hen house
Faster than a whiskey shot goes down down south

Ooh, I saw white lightning
Ooh, I saw white lightning

Faster than the Duke boys jumping that hillside
Faster than Elvis could shake, rattle, roll
Faster than the skirt flyin' up on Monroe, I said

Ooh, I saw white lightning, I said
Ooh, I saw white lightning

Faster than #3 breaking every record
Faster than a tree dies in the desert
Faster than that bug splattered on my windshield
Faster than you die when you take too many pills

Holdin' a metal umbrella when the storm started
Oh that's what love's supposed to feel like, whoa

Too much X lock my chest

With drugs taken over his body, he doesn’t want to wait until the sun sets to die, he would rather die while the high is still lasting.

'Cause it's soon one morning down the road I'm going
But I ain't going down that long, old lonesome road
All by myself
But I ain't going down that long, old lonesome road
All by myself
I can't carry you, baby, gonna carry somebody else2Embed","Released in 1968 on the aptly titled album Boogie with Canned Heat, “On the Road Again” is a psychedelic blues song about rambling down the path of life. It’s one of two signature hits for Canned Heat, an LA-based blues-rock outfit founded by Alan “Blind Owl” Wilson and Bob “The Bear” Hite. Wilson was the singer, guitarist, harmonica player, and musical mastermind, and he sings lead on both “On the Road Again” and the group’s other smash, 1968’s “Going Up the Country”.

Wilson shares co-writing credit on “On the Road Again” with Floyd Jones, whose 1953 song of the same name forms the basis of the track. It’s essentially a cover of Jones' tune—itself based on bluesman Tommy Johnson’s 1928 song “Big Road Blues”—except that Canned Heat uses guitar harmonics and an Eastern string instrument called the tambur to get a unique droning psychedelic sound. In interview with Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict, Canned Heat bassist Larry “The Mole” Taylor discussed the use of tambur.

It sort of fit into the times because the Indians used to get into that whole thing with Ravi Shankar. It kind of all went together.

Like many bands that capture the spirit of their times, Canned Heat wasn’t destined to remain in the spotlight for long. Wilson’s recording career lasted just three years, as he died of a drug overdose in September 1970. The singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and all-around blues scholar was 27 years old—just like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, who followed him into rock ‘n’ roll heaven two and four weeks later, respectively. Canned Heat continued on, but according to Taylor, it was never the same without the Blind Owl.

He had a way at expressing that music, through his knowledge of it and through his way of expressing music in general. “He was a musicologist, and he knew a lot about that old country-blues and it sort of just went together. It’s hard to put words to exactly what it was, but I can tell you this.  I still ain’t never heard anything like it.","January 21, 1968"
Canned Heat,Going Up the Country,"Going Up the Country Lyrics
I'm goin' up the country, baby, don't you wanna go?

I'm goin' to someplace where I've never been before

I'm goin', I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine
I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine
We can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time


I'm gonna leave the city, got to get away
I'm gonna leave the city, got to get away
All this fussin' and fightin', man, you know I sure can't stay

Now, baby, pack your leavin' trunk, you know we've got to leave today
Just exactly where we're goin' I cannot say, but
We might even leave the USA
'Cause there's a brand new game and I don't wanna play


No use for you runnin' or screamin' and cryin'
'Cause you've got a home as long as I've got mine1Embed",This song is essentially the essence of traveling around the country carelessly and with a group of friends. Nothing more than just a catchy tune about a road trip.,"November 22, 1968"

Its guitar riff and solo are well recognized and liked helping make it a true classic.



The blues/rock classic was part of their final album with their classic line-up Future Blues



Written and originally recorded by Wilbert Harrison, whose claim to fame came from his classic 1959 blues/country/rock hit “Kansas City”

Know what I hate to see

At night when I get old
I hope you'll look about the same
As when I was a boy

I wonder when they're going to
Destroy your face

In the sky at night
And it's sad to say
You won't shine so bright
Some day
When they're through with you

I bet you've seen the cloud we make
That covers up our rain
I wonder if you'll hide behind
A shroud like that some day

Winter wine
How you're always flowing, blowing in my mind
Like a stream, these magic waters move me to a dream
Of travelling with you, drifting carefree
Dropping downward through fresh grasses
Bubbles merrily as it passes
Never knowing where you're going
Carry me with you (carry me with you)
Carry me with you (carry me with you)

Be conjured up in a midnight dream
Ancient castles dark
As wandering minstrels play tunes of yesterday
When dragons roamed the land
Knights in armour cold charged on horseback bold
The maids were saved, the dragons slain

Sail scene, sea green
Sailing forward to a new land
Treasure waits, paradise gates
For the taking, don't start waking
All you need, but take heed
Remember it pays to pay the sandman well
Make no fuss, for you must – in stardust
He puts all the colours in your dreams
Bells chime three times
Naked dancers enter slowly
Smoky room, scented gloom
Audience eating, fat men drinking
Candles burn, a dull red light
Illuminates the breasts of four young girls
Dancing, prancing, provoking
See, dreams are always ending far too soon

Life's too short to be sad
Wishing things you'll never have
You're better off not dreaming of the things to come
Dreams are always ending far too soon

Sounds of a distant melody
Once played, lost from memory
Funny how it's clearer now you're close to me
We'll be together all the time


Sounds of a distant melody
Once played, lost from memory

Caravan,Nine Feet Underground,"Nine Feet Underground Lyrics

Look at the day that is dawning
What do you see with your eyes?
Think of me now while you're yawning
Sunshine the tears from my cries
What I see I know is real
What I touch I know I feel
If I don't care for what you say
It won't mean much to me today
For I see your world that is living
My mind is yours, yours is mine
Don't talk to me 'bout forgiving
So much to do, no more time
All my love goes straight to you
With just a thought for something new
All I have is what you feel
With hands in mouth, you gently kneel
What I see I know is real
What I touch I know I feel
All my love goes straight to you
All my love is you




There's a place where I can go
Where I listen to the wind singing
Songs of happiness I know
And it brings it all back again
Somewhere deep inside of me
There's a song that I can sing
Jigsaw puzzles on a tree
And it brings it all back again
Will the day be warm and bright, or will it snow?
There are people waiting here who really want to know
And sometimes I think of wine
Songs and laughter flowing free
People talking all the time
And it brings it all back to me
Will the day be warm and bright, or will it snow?
There are people waiting now who really have to know
Can't you feel it in the air?
I wonder what it's meant to be
It's the thought that can despair
And it brings it all back to me
Yes it brings it all back to me

Originating in several instrumental track ideas from keyboard-player David Sinclair, it was organized together by the band to form a mostly-instrumental keyboard demonstration.

Of its eight sections, only two feature vocals (with the first by Pye Hastings and the last by Richard Sinclair) and the only instrumental solo that is not played on keyboard by David Sinclair is a saxophone section provided by Pye Hastings' s brother Jimmy.

While the different parts are easy to identify, they still segue seamlessly into each other, adding up to an actual 22-minute song.","April 8, 1971"
Caravan,Golf Girl,"Golf Girl Lyrics
Standing on a golf course, dressed in PVC
I chanced upon a golf girl selling cups of tea
She asked me did I want one, asked me with a grin
For thruppence you can buy one, full right to the brim
So, of course I had to have one, in fact I ordered three
So I could watch the golf girl, could see she fancied me
And later on the golf course after drinking tea
It started raining golf balls, she protected me

Her name was Pat, and we sat
Under a tree, she kissed me
We go for walks in fine weather
All together on the golf course, we talk in morse

Once I had a dream, nothing else to do
Sat and played my mind in time with all of you
Got down in the road, crossed my heart and cried
When you told me how you'd love to live and not to die
Why why why?
I wish I were stoned on my mind

Dreamed it once again and saw that he was me
Looking close at me I looked a lot like you
Knowing where to go but not quite what to do
Why why why?

Complete with bag of nuts and fancy free

Such a feeling's coming over me
There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream
Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here/near

I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world

Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's telling me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me
There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here

Workin' together day to day, together

And when the evening comes, we smile
So much of life ahead

“‘It had all the romantic beginnings of a bank commercial’ is the way I describe it. There was actually a wonderful writer named Tony Asher who wrote for this ad agency, and he’d had a skiing accident and he broke his arm, so he couldn’t write or play the piano or whatever. So he suggested Roger Nichols and I as replacements to write this ad. The ad agency called us and said, ""Look, we’re going to show a young couple getting married, driving off into the sunset, and it’s going to say, ‘You’ve got a long way to go, we’d like to help you get there to the Crocker Bank.’” And I went, Okay, what rhymes with Crocker? Crocker what? And they said very specifically, “No we don’t want a jingle.” What they asked for is what we would today call a music video. It was going to show a young couple getting married, driving off into the sunset. After the ceremony, the first kiss and all. So Roger and I wrote the song that would play over that.","August 21, 1970"

In “Father and Son,” a father tries to calm—and keep—his wayward son, who feels that he has to start a new life for himself. Both parts are sung by Cat Stevens, with the son’s verses in a higher, more plaintive register. The father addresses the son directly, but the son soliloquizes, as though speaking to himself or to nobody at all.

Stevens has said of the song,

Some people think that I was taking the son’s side. But how could I have sung the father’s side if I couldn’t have understood it, too? I was listening to that song recently and I heard one line and realized that that was my father’s father’s father’s father’s father’s father’s father’s father speaking.

The song was first conceived of as part of a musical theater project that never materialized. It was originally meant to portray a father trying to convince his son not to go off to join the Russian Revolution.

“Father and Son” has been covered by several artists, the most notable being Boyzone in 1994 and Ronan Keating, who featured Yusef Islam in his version, in 2004, as both had major international chart success.  Recently it was introduced to new audiences in Marvel’s 2017 film *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.","November 23, 1970"

The song was not released as a single in the UK, but instead Jamaican singer Jimmy Cliff’s recording of the song (produced by Stevens himself) reached #8 there six months earlier.

While there is much speculation that Stevens wrote “Wild World” about his split with Patti D'Arbanville, he explained on The Chris Isaak Hour in 2009 that the actual inspiration for the song was his return to a career in music after nearly dying from a collapsed lung due to tuberculosis in 1969.

This would not be the first time Stevens has written a song that, on the surface, appears to be written about a girl while actually singing about himself. “Sad Lisa”, the German b-side to “Wild World” was also written about himself.

Taken literally, the lyrics seem to tell the story of a person speaking to a girl who has either grown up and is leaving her childhood home, or is ending a relationship and moving out.

Many artists have covered “Wild World” aside from Cliff. The most successful versions were by English reggae singer Maxi Priest (who took it into the top 30 in several countries) and the American rock band Mr. Big (who had a top 40 hit with it in over a dozen countries).","November 23, 1970"

In 1971, A Rolling Stone reviewer wrote:

“The Wind” is a model of economical songwriting, a far cry from the early pop songs in which Cat endlessly repeated the same trivial verse, padding it out with meaningless breaks. In less than two minutes, “The Wind” compresses Cat’s philosophy and a description of his working methods into a few mysterious images. The language is beautifully controlled, the melody is exquisite, the vocal is soulfully phrased, and the two guitars play in elegant counterpoint. A gem.","October 1, 1971"

which had been found in L. McBean’s Songs And Hymns Of The Gael published in 1900, the tune was used as a Christmas carol.
In 1931, English poet and author Eleanor Farjeon was asked to make a poem to fit the tune.

“Morning Has Broken” appeared on Cat Stevens' Teaser And The Firecat album released October 1, 1971. Produced by ex-Yardbirds bassist Paul Samwell-Smith, the gospel song features a piano arrangement composed and performed by Rick Wakeman, a classically trained keyboardist well known from as a member of English prog-rockers Yes.

The single peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped Billboard’s Adult Contemporary chart for a week in May of 1972.

In 2000, Wakeman in an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live said he had agreed to perform on the Cat Stevens track for £10 and was “shattered” that he was omitted from the credits, adding he never received the money either.
On his return to performance as Yusuf Islam, Stevens made a payment to Wakeman and apologized for the original non-payment, which arose from confusion and a misunderstanding on the record label’s part.

Now I've been happy lately
Thinkin' about the good things to come

The 1970s was near the end of Vietnam war ( the war ended in 1975) because of the many protests against the war during this time songs with messages of peace, like Peace Train, were common.
The song is a promotion of peace using the train as an analogy to encourage a sense of unity, we all should get on the “peace train”.","October 1, 1971"
Cat Stevens,Trouble,"Trouble LyricsTrouble
Oh trouble set me free
I have seen your face
And it’s too much too much for me
Trouble
Oh trouble can’t you see
You’re eating my heart away
And there’s nothing much left of me
I’ve drunk your wine
You have made your world mine
So won’t you be fair
So won’t you be fair
I don’t want no more of you
So won’t you be kind to me
Just let me go where
I’ll have to go there

Oh trouble move away
I have seen your face
And it’s too much for me today

Oh trouble can’t you see
You have made me a wreck
Now won’t you leave me in my misery
I’ve seen your eyes
And I can see death’s disguise
Hangin’ on me
Hangin’ on me
I’m beat, I’m torn
Shattered and tossed and worn
Too shocking to see
Too shocking to see

Oh trouble move from me
I have paid my debt
Now won’t you leave me in my misery

Oh trouble please be kind
I don’t want no fight
And I haven’t got a lot of timeEmbed","Trouble came out on his third album Mona Bone Jakon in 1970.

Stevens, considered a young teen sensation, was overwhelmed by a new lifestyle, as well as the demands of writing, recording, performing, publicity appearances, and touring. In the fall of 1968, he collapsed, with the diagnosis of tuberculosis and a collapsed lung.

Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam performs a live version of the song.","April 24, 1970"

Charlie Parker,Now’s the Time,"Now’s the Time LyricsWhy don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you
Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you
Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
Write these extended bridges
Can it be romance that always
Haunts me in my reverie?
So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
Just for me too
Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend
Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again
Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then
Blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it
Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
Assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool
So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me
New York, and we're together in my reverie
So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more JeruEmbed","“Now’s the Time” is a riff-based blues, with typical bebop phrase endings at the end of bars 5 and 6. “Now’s the Time” was first recorded on November 26, 1945, by Charlie Parker’s Re-Boppers, featuring Miles Davis, Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie, Curley Russell and Sadik Hakim. The melody of “Now’s the Time” was used for “The Hucklebuck”, a hit for saxophonist Paul Williams four years after Parker’s original recording. Despite being released by the same record label with the same producer, Parker was not credited; instead, the composition was attributed to Andy Gibson.",1945

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dreamEmbed",?,1950

Cheap Trick,The Flame,"The Flame Lyrics
Another night slowly closes in
And I feel so lonely
Touching heat freezing on my skin
I pretend you still hold me
I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep
I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you
I can't believe you're gone
You were the first, you'll be the last

Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember, after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame

Watching shadows move across the wall
I feel so frightened
I wanna run to you, I wanna call
But I've been hit by lightning
Just can't stand up for fallin' apart
Can't see through this veil across my heart, over you
You'll always be the one
You were the first, you'll be the last
Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember after the fire, after all the rain

Oh! Whatever you want, I'll give it to you1Embed","In an interview by Gerry Galipault (of Pause & Play), Bun E. Carlos explained the origin of the song, unusual for Cheap Trick being written by professional songwriters as opposed to being written or co-written by their guitarist Rick Nielsen.

Tom rejoined (in 1988), and then the vice president at Epic told us he had these two songs and they’re both gonna be No. 1. He goes, ‘We got one for you and one for the group Chicago, but you can have first choice.’ He said, ‘I think the one ‘The Flame’ would be good for you guys.’ The other one was ‘Look Away’, and it sounded like some girl singing on the demo. We really didn’t like that song anyway, so ‘Sure, we’ll do ‘The Flame.’ We’re game.’

The song focuses on the first love of the narrator. The narrator can’t seem to move on after their first love and still carries a torch (i.e. the “flame” referenced in the chorus and title of the song) for their former partner, despite that love being unrequited.",March 1988

The Chemical Brothers,Galvanize,"Galvanize Lyrics
Don't hold back, 'cause you woke up in the morning
With initiative to move, so why make it harder?
Don't hold back, if you think about it
So many people do, be cool man, look smarter
Don't hold back, and you shouldn't even care
'Bout the losers in the air and their crooked stares
Don't hold back, 'cause there's a party over here
So you might as well be here where the people care

Don't hold back, world (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)

Come on, come on, come on with it

Don't hold back, if you think about it too much
You may stumble, trip up, fall on your face
Don't hold back, you think it's time you get up
Crunch time like a sit-up, c'mon keep pace
Don't hold back, put apprehension on the back burner
Let it sit, don't even get it lit
Don't hold back, get involved with the jam
Don't be a prick, hot chick be a pig
Don't hold back, world (You're holding back)
The time has come to

The time has come to

Come on with that, come on with it

The Chemical Brothers,The Salmon Dance,"The Salmon Dance Lyrics
Hello, boys and girls, my name is Fatlip
And this is my friend, Sammy the Salmon (What it do?)
Today, we're gonna teach you some fun facts about salmon
And a brand new dance

Let me introduce to you a brand new dance
I know you're gonna love it if you give it one chance
It's not complicated, it's not too hard
You don't even have to be a hip-hop star
See anyone can do it, all you need is style
Listen up, peep game, I'ma show you how
Put your hands to the side, as silly as it seems
And shake your body like a salmon floating up stream

I'll float up stream
(You know how we do it, you know how we do it)
Again

All my peeps spend part of their life in freshwater
And part of their life in saltwater
Wow, very interesting
We change 'round a couple of days after spawning, then we die
When I first did the salmon, all the people just laughed
They looked around and stood like I was on crack
I heard somebody say out loud, ""What the fuck is that?
This nigga's dancing like a fish, while he's doing The Snap""
But the more I kept doing it, the more they were feeling it
And then I heard some bitches say, ""Yo, that nigga's killing it""
By the end of the night, everyone was on my team
And the whole club was dancing like a salmon floating up stream

I'll float up stream
(You know how we do it, you know how we do it)
Again

Most of our friends find their home waters by sense of smell
Which is even more keen than that of a dog or a bear
Wow!
My family also rely on ocean currents, tides (Uh-huh)
Gravitational pull of the moon (I'll float up stream)
The moon? Fish pay attention to the moon?!
Wow! Who knew? (Again)
Did you know...
What?
...that I could go to Japan and back?
You're kidding me! Amazing... geez
Polluted water can kill both baby salmon that are developing
And the adult salmon that are on their way to spawn
Wow, what a shame, what a shame
Huh? Whoa!
Wow, hey, kids, hey, give it up for Sammy the Salmon
And his amazing Salmon Dance
Huh, what do you say? Alright
Who's hungry?4Embed","A song from the album “We Are the Night” from the Chemical Brothers, it features two characters: The character Fatlip (which is dubbed by the artist Fatlip) and Sammy, the salmon.

Cher,Believe,"Believe Lyrics
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love

No matter how hard I try, you keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through, there's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving, it takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done, you're gonna be the lonely one, oh

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

What am I supposed to do, sit around and wait for you?
Well, I can't do that, and there's no turning back
I need time to move on, I need love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through and maybe I'm too good for you, oh
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Well, I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
I don't need you anymore, oh, I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore, no, I don't need you anymore

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say

Do you believe in life after love?32Embed","Cher’s “Believe” is about getting over heartbreak. It pioneered the use of Auto-Tune as a recognizable vocal effect; at the time it was known as the “Cher effect”.

According to The New York Times the song took nine years to make. In 1990, songwriter Brian Higgins wrote the initial hook but was unhappy with the verses, so other writers began tinkering with the lyrics and production. Higgins tried pitching the song to various artists he wrote for over the years, but they all passed on it.

Meanwhile, the president of Warner Music UK, Rob Dickins, wanted Cher to “focus on her gay audience with a high-energy dance record.” Dickins told The New York Times that when he heard “Believe” he thought to himself, “Cher could do this chorus, especially the lyrics, with her private life the way it is. She’s gone through all these things.”

After recording the song, the producers worried Cher’s vocals sounded too robotic due to the Auto-Tune. Cher told the Times:  “‘Everyone loves that song but wants to change that part of it. I said, 'You can change that part of it, over my dead body!’”

In an interview with Sound on Sound, the song’s producers actually lied about using Auto-Tune and claimed Cher’s vocal effects were created using a vocoder pedal. They were trying to keep Auto-Tune a secret, but it eventually became an industry standard.

The song became a huge international smash, landing at #1 in the US and many other countries including in Italy, Germany, and Spain. It sold over 11 million copies making it one of the best-selling​ singles of all time.","October 19, 1998"
Cher,If I Could Turn Back Time,"If I Could Turn Back Time Lyrics
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you and you'd stay

I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes

I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby

If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you, you'd stay
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time

My world was shattered, I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
When you walked out that door I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything, darlin', then and there
Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind and darlin'

I don't need your sympathy
There's nothing you can say or do for me
And I don't want a miracle
You'll never change for no one
And I hear your reasons why
Where did you sleep last night?
And was she worth it, was she worth it?

'Cause I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go

So you feel misunderstood
Baby have I got news for you

Chris Cornell,You Know My Name,"You Know My Name Lyrics
If you take a life, do you know what you'll give?
Odds are, you won't like what it is
When the storm arrives, would you be seen with me?
By the merciless eyes I've deceived?

I've seen angels fall from blinding heights
But you yourself are nothing so divine
Just next in line

Arm yourself because no one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize, it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?
The coldest blood runs through my veins
You know my name

If you come inside things will not be the same
When you return to the night
And if you think you've won
You never saw me change
The game that we have been playing
I've seen this diamond cut through harder men
Than you yourself, but if you must pretend
You may meet your end

Arm yourself because no one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize, it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?
The coldest blood runs through my veins

Try to hide your hand
Forget how to feel
(Forget how to feel)
Life is gone with just a spin of the wheel
(Spin of the wheel)

Arm yourself because no one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize, it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?
The coldest blood runs through my veins
You know my name
You know my name

The song is written from the perspective of M, who, as the head of MI6, or the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), manages a class of elite agents known as the 00s (of which James Bond is number 7). The film told a Bond origin story, with a more violent, vulnerable, and ultimately more human Bond − which the title song reflects. Casino Royale opens with a pretitle scene where Bond earns his licence to kill, which cuts to the song. Throughout “You Know My Name”, M seems to give 007 his job description, and many themes discussed throughout the Daniel Craig incarnation are present: the emotional weight of the job, its psychological and physical toll, the close relationship M will form with Bond, and Bond’s ultimate replacability, like any field agent, for the greater good.

The catchy couplet seems to be the only lines in the song said by Bond, which is a play on how famous he is (inarguably the most famous in his elite league), despite being a secret agent with a code number. We know his name.","November 13, 2006"
Chris Cornell,Seasons,"Seasons Lyrics
Summer nights and long warm days
Are stolen as the old moon falls
And the mirror shows another face
Another place to hide it all
Another place to hide it all

And I'm lost, behind
The words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As seasons roll on by

Sleeping with a full moon blanket
Sand and feathers for my head
Dreams have never been the answer
And dreams have never made my bed
Dreams have never made my bed

And I'm lost, behind
And the words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As the seasons roll on by
Yeah
Woo hoo
Now I want to fly above the storm
But you can't grow feathers in the rain
And the naked floor is cold as hell
The naked floor reminds me
Oh, the naked floor reminds me

That I'm lost, behind
The words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As the seasons roll on by

If I should be short on words
And long on things to say
Could you crawl into my world
And take me worlds away?
Should I be beside myself
And not even stay
Ooooooooooo

And I'm lost, behind
The words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As the seasons roll on by

Chris replied “Seasons… it was written in a time when Seattle was moving so fast….. and I just wanted to slow it all down.”

This makes a lot of sense since this song came out for the 1992 film Singles (dir. Cameron Crowe) (who later on directed the Pearl Jam Twenty documentary) but 1992 in Seattle/Grunge music was at all time high.

Acts like Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Mudhoney, Nirvana were very popular and with all of their combined success time started flying by like Cornell said.","June 30, 1992"

It's been seven hours and sixteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whoever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares
To you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me
Where did I go wrong?
I can throw my arms around any girl I choose
But it just reminds me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me
He said, ""Boy, you better try to have fun
No matter what you do""
But he's a fool
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares
To you

All the flowers that you planted mama in your backyard
All died when you went away
And I know living with me is sometimes hard, but I'm willing
To give it another try

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares
To you

Nothing compares

Chris Cornell,Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart,"Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart Lyrics
Every time I stare into the sun
Trying to find a reason to go on
All I ever get is burned and blind
Until the sky bleeds the pouring rain

When you came along, the time was right
Pulled me like an apple, red and ripe
Wasn't very long, you took a bite
And did me wrong, and it serves me right

And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go round again gain

Every little key unlocks the door
Every little secret has a lie
Try to take a picture of the sun
And it won't help you to see the light

Every little word upon your lips
Makes a little cut where blood pours out
Every little drop of blood, a kiss
That I won't miss, not for anything
And I nearly forgot my broken heart
It's taken me miles away
From the memory of how it broke apart
Here we go round again

Every single feeling tells me this is leading
To a heart in broken little pieces
And you know I need this
Like a hole in the head


Every single feeling tells me this is leading
To a heart in broken little pieces
And you know I need this
Like a hole...

Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry

The song reached #1 on Billboard’s Country Songs chart after Stapleton performed it as a duet with Justin Timberlake at the 2015 CMA Awards.

Ironically (given Stapleton’s notoriety as a songwriter), ”Tennessee Whiskey” is a cover of a country classic—it was a minor hit for David Allan Coe in 1981, and a major hit for George Jones in 1983.

Many have also noted the updated arrangement’s resemblance to Etta James' 1968 R&B classic “I’d Rather Go Blind” (a song Beyoncé covered in the 2008 movie Cadillac Records).

Stapleton recalled the cover’s genesis in an interview with Fader:


It’s always been a favorite song of mine. We had a show in Charlottesville, and we were sound checking, waiting around for the mics to get set up. Me and the guys in the band started playing a little bit and got into that groove, so I started thinking, “Man, what song could I sing over top of this?“ For whatever reason, I started singing “Tennessee Whiskey.”

At the time, we had a steel player by the name of Steve Hinson who used to play with George Jones on the road—maybe that was part of the equation. But we decided to do the song that night and every night since. By the time we got into the studio, it was something we all enjoyed playing. It’s a part of the fabric of things that influenced me over the years.","November 4, 2015"

Chris wrote it with Michael (Mike) Henderson and told Rolling Stone Magazine in an interview why it was important for him to include it on the album:

I wrote that song with my dear friend Mike Henderson, with whom I probably wrote more songs than anyone who is a co-writer of mine. I didn’t include any songs I’d written with him on Traveller, so it was really important to me … to cut songs from some of the guys who helped me learn how to write songs, and Mike is one of those guys.

Broken Halos is a song about people close to us who pass away. At his concert at the Ryman Auditorium in February 2017, Stapleton introduced the song by noting that he wrote it on the day a childhood friend passed away from pancreatic cancer at the age of 37.

Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood

But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go

Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track

Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

Go Johnny go, go

His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band

To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'""

It tells the tale of a boy with humble beginnings with a talent for guitar. Some details were changed: Berry was from St. Louis, not Louisiana, and he knew how to read and write very well. He graduated from beauty school with a degree in hairdressing and cosmetology. The song is well known for its catchy guitar riff.

In 1977, NASA sent a copy of this on the Voyager space probe as part of a package that was meant to represent the best in American culture. Someday, aliens could find it and discover Chuck Berry.

According to Back to the Future, Marty McFly might have had a hand in inspiring the song.

Chuck Berry,My Ding A Ling,"My Ding A Ling Lyrics
When I was a little bitty boy
My grandmother bought me a cute little toy
Silver bells hangin' on a string
She told me it was my ding a ling ling

My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling

When mamma took me to Sunday School
They tried to teach me the golden rule
Every time the choir would sing
I'd sit there and play with my ding a ling

My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling

When Pa started me to Grammar School
I found a place in the vestibule
And every time the bell would ring
They'd catch me playin' with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling

Once I was climbing the garden wall
Oh and I had an awful fall
I fell so hard I heard bells ring
But I never let go of my ding a ling

My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling

I remember the girl next door
We used to play house on the kitchen floor
She'd be the queen, I'd be the king
Together we'd play with my ding a ling a ling

My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
This here song, it is so sad
To those of you who never had
Silver bells hanging on a string
So you could play with your own ding a ling

My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
All come on now, everybody sing
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling (One more time)4Embed","Originally written and recorded by David Bartholemew in 1952, “My Ding A Ling” was discovered and recorded by Chuck Berry in 1972.

At the tail end of a long and illustrious career as a founding father of rock n' roll, this novelty song would ironically become Berry’s only #1 single on the US pop charts.

Chuck Berry,Maybellene,"Maybellene Lyrics
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started doing the things you used to do

As I was motorvatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a Coupe DeVille
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford
The Cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five
She's bumper to bumper rollin' side by side

Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing the things you used to do

A Cadillac pulled up to one hundred and four
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It done got a cloud and started to rain
I tooted my horn for the passin' lane
The rain water blowin' all under my hood
I knew that was doin' my motor good
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do


Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
You done started back doing the things you used to do

The motor cooled down, the heat went down
And that's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill

Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do4Embed","The first song ever recorded by Chuck Berry in Chess Studios, this reworking of the classic song “Ida Red” was chuck’s first hit. Willie Dixon played bass, Johnnie Johnson played piano, Chuck Berry played guitar and sang,  Jerome Green played maracas, Ebby Hardy played drums.

Phil Chess showed particular interest in this song (while Willie Dixon apparently had little faith in it) because it was a country song being sung by a black man, and because it featured fast cars as a central theme. This combination, he believed had crossover appeal especially when paired with “Wee Wee Hours” a bluesier number on the B side. When all four songs from Berry’s first session were sent to Alan Freed “Maybellene” became a national sensation.

Johnnie Johnson claims that the song’s title was changed from “Ida May” (the name chuck had been using) to “Maybellene” after Phil suggested a change and chuck berry saw a bottle of maybelline perfume on the ground.

I want my jockey to play

You know my temperature's risin'
The jukebox blowin' a fuse

And my soul keep a-singin' the blues

Go get your lover, then reel and rock it
Roll it over then move on up just
A trifle further and reel and rock with

Roll over Beethoven
Dig these rhythm and blues

Well, early in the mornin', and I'm givin' you my warnin'
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey, diddle diddle, I'ma play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven

Dance like a spinnin' top

Chuck Berry,"Memphis, Tennessee","Memphis, Tennessee Lyrics
Long distance information, give me Memphis, Tennessee
Help me find the party trying to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number, but I know who placed the call
Because my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall

Ah, help me, information, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge

Ah, help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis, Tennessee

Last time I saw Marie, she was waving me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
Marie is only six years old, information please
Try to put me through to her in Memphis, TennesseeEmbed","From his autobiography: “""Memphis Tennessee” was recorded in my first office building at 4221 west Easton Avenue in St. Louis on a $145 homemade studio in the heat of a muggy July afternoon with a $79 reel to reel sears Roebuck recorder that had provisions for sound on sound recording. I played the guitar and bass track, and i added the ticky-tick drums that trot along in the background which sound so good to me. I worked over a month revising the lyric before I took the tape up to Leonard Chess to listen to. He was again pressed for a release since my concerts (driving on the road then) kept me from the recording studio for long periods.

The story of “Memphis” got it' roots from a very old and quiet bluesy selection by muddy waters played when I was in my teens that went “long distance operator give me (something….something), I want to talk to my baby she’s (something else).” Sorry I don’t remember anymore now but I did then and spirited my rendition of that feeling into my song of Memphis. My wife had relatives there who we were visiting semi annually but other than a couple of concerts there, I had never had any basis for choosing Memphis for the location of the story.

The situation in the story was intended to have a wide scope of interest to the general public rather than a rare or particular incidental occurrence that would entreat the memory of only a few. Such a portrayal of popular or general situations and conditions in lyrics has always been my greatest objective in writing.",August 1963

It became the band’s only number-one single on the UK Singles Chart, a decade after it was originally released. In November 2004, it was ranked at 228 on Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

The song contains backing vocals in Spanish due to Joe Strummer’s fondness for Spain and its language.

On the spur of the moment I said “I’m going to do the backing vocals in Spanish” We needed a translator so Eddie Garcia, the tape operator, called his mother in Brooklyn Heights and read her the lyrics over the phone and she translated them. But Eddie and his mum are Ecuadorian, so it’s Ecuadorian Spanish that me and Joe Ely are singing on the backing vocals.

You have to let that raga drop

Has been shaken to the top

He went a' cruisin' down the ville
The Muezzin was a'standing
On the radiator grille

Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah

By order of the prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
But the Bedouin they brought out
The electric kettle drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar pickin' thumb
As soon as the Shareef
Cleared the square
They began to wail

Now over at the temple
Oh! They really pack 'em in
The in crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
And the temple band took five
The crowd caught a whiff
Of that crazy Casbah jive

Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way""

Chauffeured outta there

The cockpit radio blare
As soon as the Shareef was
Out of their hair

The song’s music and original lyrics were written by drummer Topper Headon. But frontman Joe Strummer tossed Headon’s ‘very pornographic’ lyrics aside and began writing his own after the band’s manager complained that each song written thus far on Combat Rock was too long. He reportedly shouted in the studio, “Does everything have to be as long as raga?!” – to which Strummer responded by writing the opening lines to this song. He then wrote the rest of its lyrics about people being “lashed for owning a disco album in Iran” – something he was once told.

By the time “Rock The Casbah” was released, its original songwriter Headon had been kicked out of the band. Previous Clash drummer Terry Chimes appeared in the song’s video in his place.

After “Rock The Casbah” became a hit, Joe Strummer considered leaving The Clash because he couldn’t justify singing rebellious songs when the band was rich and successful. In their early years, when they were struggling, their music was sincere, but he felt they were becoming a joke. The band later broke up in 1985.

Strummer was further disheartened in 1991 when the song (along with “Killing An Arab” by The Cure) was being misinterpreted as anti-Arab anthems during Operation Desert Storm in Iraq.","June 11, 1982"
The Clash,London Calling,"London Calling Lyrics
London calling to the faraway towns
Now war is declared and battle come down
London calling to the underworld
Come outta' the cupboard, ya' boys and girls

Quit holdin' out and draw another breath
London calling and I don't want to shout
But while we were talking I saw you noddin' out

Cause London is drowning, I, I live by the river


The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growin' thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Cause London is drowning, I, I live by the river

And ya' know what they said? Well, some of it was true!
(London calling) at the top of the dial
And after all this, won't you give me a smile?
(London calling)

I never felt so much alike alike alike...35Embed","The title “London Calling” alludes to the BBC World Service’s station identification: “This is London calling …”, which was used during World War II, often in broadcasts to occupied countries.



Lyrically the song reflects the concern felt by Strummer about world events with the line about “a nuclear error” being an allusion to the incident at Three Mile Island, which occurred earlier in 1979. Joe Strummer has said: “We felt that we were struggling about to slip down a slope or something, grasping with our fingernails. And there was no one there to help us.”

The lyrics also reflect the desperation of the band’s situation in 1979 struggling with high debt, the lack of management, and arguing with their record label over whether the London Calling album should be a single or double album. The lines “Now don’t look to us / Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust” reflect the concerns of the band over its situation after the punk rock boom in England had ended in 1977.

Musically, the song is far removed from their earlier style of frenzied punk rock I-IV-V-I chord progressions, as best exemplified on songs like “Career Opportunities” and “I’m So Bored with the U.S.A.”. The song is in a minor key (something The Clash had rarely used before) and the inherent dirge-like, apocalyptic feel is intensified by Topper Headon’s martial drumming without backbeat, in synchrony with staccato guitar chords; Paul Simonon’s haunting and pulsating bass line; the group’s deliberate, mid-tempo pace; and Strummer’s icy lyrics and baleful delivery. Strummer’s howls during the instrumental break further fuel the atmosphere of paranoia.

“London Calling” was The Clash’s first single from their third album London Calling.
For the single the band recorded their fifth music video, on Battersea Pier.

The Clash,Spanish Bombs,"Spanish Bombs Lyrics
Spanish songs in Andalucía
The shooting site in the days of '39
Oh, please, leave the ventana open
Federico Lorca is dead and gone
Bullet holes in the cemetery walls
The black cars of the Guardia Civil
Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica
I'm flyin' in on a DC 10 tonight

Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh, mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh mi corazón

Spanish weeks in my disco casino
The freedom fighters died upon the hill
They sang the red flag, they wore the black one
After they died it was Mockingbird Hill
Back home the buses went up in flashes
The Irish tomb was drenched in blood
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels
My señorita's rose was nipped in the bud
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh, mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh mi corazón

The hillsides ring with ""Free the people""
Or can I hear the echo from the days of '39?
With trenches full of poets, the ragged army
Fixin' bayonets to fight the other line
Spanish bombs rock the province
I'm hearin' music from another time
Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava
I'm flyin' in on a DC 10 tonight

Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh, mi corazón

The song was written by Strummer on a journey home from the recording studio, when he heard a story about Basque protesters bombing holiday resorts on the Costa Brava.

Although the song talks about the Spanish Civil War, it is actually talking about modern day (in 1979) Spain and comparing/contrasting it with Spain 40 years before.

The hillsides sing with “Free the people""
Or can I hear the echo from the days of ‘39
– Spanish Bombs

It also compares/contrasts the Basque freedom fighters with the provisional IRA, who had similar bombing tactics in the 70s in the UK.

Lead vocals on this song are shared by Joe Strummer and Mick Jones. Strummer mainly sings the verse, while Jones sings the chorus.

This style of singing some words together heavily influenced the vocal style of The Libertines.","December 14, 1979"
The Clash,Straight to Hell,"Straight to Hell Lyrics
If you can play on fiddle
How's about a British jig and reel?
Speaking King's English in quotation
As railhead towns feel the steel mills rust
Water froze in the generation
Clear as winter ice
This is your paradise

There ain't no need for ya
There ain't no need for ya
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys

Wanna join in a chorus
Of the Amerasian blues?
When it's Christmas out in Ho Chi Minh City
Kiddie say papa papa papa papa papa-san take me home
See me got photo photo
Photograph of you
And Mamma Mamma Mamma-san
Of you and Mamma Mamma Mamma-san
Let me tell you 'bout your blood bamboo kid
It ain't Coca-Cola, it's rice
Straight to hell, boy
Go straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys

Oh Papa-san
Please take me home

Everybody they wanna go home
So Mamma-san says


You wanna play mind-crazed banjo
On the druggy-drag ragtime U.S.A.?
In Parkland International
Ha, Junkiedom U.S.A
Where procaine proves the purest rock man groove
And rat poison
The volatile Molotov says

Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah
Straight to hell
Can you cough it up loud and strong?
The immigrants
They wanna sing all night long
It could be anywhere
Most likely could be any frontier
Any hemisphere
No man's land
There ain't no asylum here
King Solomon he never lived 'round here

Straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys
Oh Pappa-san, please take me home
Everybody they wanna go home now9Embed","“Straight to Hell” is a song about immigration, from a British and American perspective.

The first verse deals with the UK, which saw immigration from its former colonies in the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent after WW2.

The second is about the children of American soldiers in Vietnam. These American-Vietnamese were stopped from gaining American citizenship.

The third verse takes a more general view, in “any frontier, any hemisphere”.

The music from the song was famously sampled by the American producer Diplo in the song “Paper Planes”, which he wrote with Sri Lanka-born singer M.I.A.. That is also a song that deals with the mistreatment and stigmatization of foreigners.","September 17, 1982"

Hey, Paul

When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun?
When the law break in
How you gonna go?
Shot down on the pavement
Or waiting in death row?

You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton

The money feels good
And your life you like it well
But surely your time will come
As in heaven, as in hell

You see, he feels like Ivan
Born under the Brixton sun
His game is called survivin'
At the end of The Harder They Come
You know it means no mercy
They caught him with a gun
No need for the Black Maria
Goodbye to the Brixton sun

You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton

When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun?

You can crush us
You can bruise us
You can even shoot us

Shot down on the pavement
Waiting in death row

As in heaven, as in hell

Written as a protest about the economic situation for UK youth at the time, this song continues to be influential, having been covered by artists from Red Hot Chili Peppers to Arcade Fire.

This is the first Clash song to feature bassist Paul Simonon on vocals, a rarity for the Strummer/Jones-led group. Its lyrics describe the paranoia of living in the Clash’s apocalyptic version of London that pervades the entire record. Structurally, the album follows closely after the similarly themed “Clampdown.” While “Clampdown” paints a picture of the bleak global situation and calls for the masses to take action against it, “The Guns of Brixton” complicates the issue by addressing the complications that violence can introduce. It is also the last song on disc one of London Calling.

Additionally, it was revisited by the Clash themselves on their following album, Sandinista! This time, however, it was sung by a little girl and featured at the end of the track “Broadway.”","December 14, 1979"
The Clash,Lost in the Supermarket,"Lost in the Supermarket Lyrics
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality

I wasn't born, so much as I fell out
Nobody seemed to notice me
We had a hedge back home in the suburbs
Over which I never could see
I heard the people who live on the ceiling
Scream and fight, most scarily
Hearing that noise was my first ever feelin'
That's how it's been, all around me

I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality

I'm all tuned in, I see all the programs
I save coupons from packets of tea
I've got my giant hit, discotheque album
I empty a bottle, I feel a bit free
The kids in halls and the pipes in the walls
Making noises for company
Long distance callers make long distance calls
And the silence makes me lonely
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality

And it's not here
It disappeared

I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily

Climax Blues Band,Couldn’t Get It Right,"Couldn’t Get It Right Lyrics

Time was drifting
This rocker got to roll
So I hit the road and made my getaway
Restless feeling, really got a hold
I started searching for a better way

But I kept on looking for a sign
In the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way
To take me through the night
I couldn't get it right
I couldn't get it right

LA fever made me feel alright
But I must admit it got the best of me
Getting down, so deep I could have drowned
Now, I can't get back the way I used to be

But I kept on looking for a sign
In the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way
To take me through the night
I couldn't get it right
I couldn't get it right

New York City took me with the tide
And I nearly died from hospitality
Left me stranded, took away my pride
Just another no account fatality

But I kept on looking for a sign
In the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way
To take me through the night
I couldn't get it right
I couldn't get it right
I kept on looking for a sign
In the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light

To take me through the night

To take me through the night

Another “road” song – covering a segment of the life on the road of travelling musicians.



Per Derek Holt, bass player and singer –

When we first started in America, we used to fly everywhere; sometimes we’d have 3 flights a day to get to any one place…Towards the latter sort of probably five years of the band’s life, we started using tour buses, so you could sort of leave after the gig, get on the bus, get a bed, drive 1,000 miles…

From their 1976 highest selling album Gold Plate where the song was a late addition – a result from a request fot a “hit” by its producers.","January 1, 1976"

At first it was straightforward – it was a dude who didn’t have much going for him, except by god he was muscular.  Then someone got the idea of using it as a backhanded compliment for a woman … then someone left out the “shit” part … pretty soon people didn’t realize that it was insulting at all, and it just became an honest compliment for beautifully thick women.

Commodores,Three Times a Lady,"Three Times a Lady Lyrics
Thanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in my mind
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud

You're once
Twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once
Twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
I love you

You shared my dreams
My joys
My pains
You made my life worth living for
And if I had to live my life over again, dear
I'd spend each and every moment with you

You're once
Twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once
Twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
I love you
When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
To touch you
To hold you
To feel you
To need you
There's nothing to keep us apart

You're once
Twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
You're once
Twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once
Twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
I love youEmbed","Three Times a Lady is a song from the Commodores‘ sixth album Natural High.

The song was written by Lionel  Richie after being inspired by a comment his father said to his mother.

According to an interview Lionel did with Blues & Soul Magazine in 1979:

I wrote it back in 1978 and it was a very personal meaning to me. I attended the wedding anniversary of my parents and my father made a speech about how much he loved my mother and appreciated the way she had stood beside him for 37 years. It was beautiful and I started to think about my own life and how my wife stands by me, how she does so many things without being asked or thanked. So, I wrote ‘Three Times A Lady’ as a dedication to my wife and my mother. I think my next door neighbor summed it up when she said that if a man wanted to buy her a present, all he need do is buy her that record and he wouldn’t have to say anything else.“

Three Times a Lady became a big hit for the Commodores, topping the Billboard Hot 100, R&B Singles chart and Adult Contemporary chart. It also topped the U.K. Singles chart for 5 weeks.",1978
Commodores,Still,"Still Lyrics
Lady, morning's just a moment away
And I'm without you once again
You laughed at me
You said you never needed me
I wonder if you need me now

We played the games that people play
We made mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
Remembering the pain if I must say
It's deep in my mind and locked away
But then most of all
I do love you
Still

Those memories
Times I'm sure we'll never forget
Those feelings we can't put aside
For what we had
Sometimes I try to understand
But it's so heavy on my mind
So many dreams that flow away
So many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm
Where did we go?
Where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found
You know we let each other down
But then most of all
I do love You
Still
We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
'Cause I needed you so desperately!
We were too blind to see
But then most of all
I do love You

Sail on down the line
'Bout a half a mile or so
And don't really wanna know
Where you're going
Maybe once or twice you see
Time after time I tried to
To hold on to what we got
But now you're going

And I don't mind about the
Things you're gonna say, Lord
I gave all my money and my time
I know it's a shame
But I'm giving you back your name
Yeah, yeah

Yes, I'll be on my way
I won't be back to stay
I guess I'll move along
I'm looking for a good time

Sail on down the line
Ain't it funny how the time can go
All my friends say they told me so
But it doesn't matter
It was plain to see that
A small town boy like me
Just wasn't your cup of tea
I was wishful thinking
I gave you my heart and
I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say
Would you please just go away
Yeah, yeah

I've thrown away the blues
I'm tired of being used
I want everyone to know
I'm looking for a good time

Common,The Light,"The Light Lyrics

Yeah, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo, yo

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them, ‘cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light
But they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest
And hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most high
Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh, darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to
Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love, it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal, it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
I'll take my chances
Before they pass
Pass me by, oh, darling
You need to look at the other side

The song has been one of Common’s most successful songs, as it is a rare instance in hip hop that deviates from a misogynistic depiction of women— the other significant example being Method Man’s “You’re All I Need”. It is also acclaimed for J Dilla’s production, widely considered one of his greatest works. For Complex, Andrew Barber writes:

At the turn of the century, Dilla had mastered his warm and fuzzy boom-bap style of production, and by the time the “The Light” hit he’d reached his peak. The next phase of Jay Dee’s production style was more digital, but this was a welcome goodbye to that era, which also gave Common the biggest hit of his career.

The song was also Common’s second Grammy nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance. Check out some of his verified annotations below.","July 18, 2000"
Common,I Used to Love H.E.R.,"I Used to Love H.E.R. Lyrics
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat Com Sense'll be the sure shot, come on

I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl, she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic-checkin' her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out, and listen to her
Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
‘Cause we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh, yo, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister
Boy, I tell you, I miss her
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop

A-Com Sense y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
UAC, yo, we gotta be the sure shot

Now periodically I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
About my people she was teachin' me
By not preachin' to me but speakin' to me
In a method that was leisurely, so easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool
Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expandin', so why should I stand in her way?
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did stud, she got big pub, but what was foul
She said that the pro-black was goin' out of style
She said, ""Afrocentricity was of the past""
So she got into R&B, hip-house, bass, and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becomin' well-rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin' fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat Com gotta be the sure shot
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
If you don't check it, mm-mm, bust it, bust it

I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin' bout poppin' Glocks, servin' rocks and hittin' switches
Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
Tellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin' how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed (girl, he's committed) but so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same lettin' all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin' her and takin' her to the sewer
But I'ma take her back, hopin' that the shit stop
‘Cause who I'm talkin' about, y'all, is hip-hop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
Mainframe, yo, they gotta be the sure shot
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, Com Sense is gonna drop, haha

You ain't got your woman in check, man?
I think you’re overstepping your bounds just a little bit
I can't do this anymore74Embed","On “I Used to Love H.E.R.,” the classic first single off his 1994 sophomore album Resurrection, Common Sense (who now goes by Common for legal reasons) tells the story of a girl he met as a kid with whom he eventually fell in love. Over the years, though, they have drifted apart due to the girl’s changing personas.

It isn’t until the very end of the song that Common reveals that he hasn’t been rapping about a girl at all, but using the phases of the woman’s life as a metaphor for the evolution of hip-hop.

In a 1995 interview on Yo! MTV Raps, Common talked about the theme of the song:

It’s about hip-hop music. H.E.R. stands for Hip-Hop in its Essence is Real. And all I’m talking about his how I first came into contact with hip-hop music and how it evolved into where it is now. And it’s like all these gimmicks going on, all the phoniness, ain’t nobody being real with it. Everybody’s stressing that it’s real but ain’t nobody being true to it. I think that came about because — once it started becoming a business, then people started losing their soul and they started looking at it, taking it more as a business than an artform.

This track incited a feud between Common and Ice Cube over a perceived diss to the West Coast corrupting hip-hop, causing Cube to diss Common on the Westside Connection track “Westside Slaughterhouse” in 1995 and leading Common to respond with his classic diss track “The Bitch in Yoo”.

Common’s manager Derek Dudley spoke about the decision to release “I Used To Love H.E.R.” as a single:

We picked it as a single because we felt like “Man, this song is going to grab everyone’s attention.” We felt like this was the song we had to come out with at the time. It wasn’t like we thought it would give us the best chance at radio or anything like that. We just knew it was a song that would pull people’s heartstrings. One of those songs that would grab people emotionally more than anything. People just connected to it.

In 2007 Kanye West produced and featured in the single “I Still Love H.E.R.” by the Teriyaki Boyz, and Murs created an updated version in 2010 with 9th Wonder called “I Used to Luv H.E.R. (Again)”

Common,Glory,"Glory Lyrics
One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory
(Glory, glory) Ohh (Glory, glory)

Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon
Formed against, yes glory is destined
Every day women and men become legends
Sins that go against our skin become blessings
The movement is a rhythm to us
Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin' us
Justice for all just ain't specific enough
One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
True and livin' livin' in us, resistance is us
That's why Rosa sat on the bus
That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up
When it go down we woman and man up
They say, ""Stay down"", and we stand up
Shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up
King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up
One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory (glory, glory)
Ohh (glory, glory)

Now the war is not over, victory isn't won
But we'll fight on to the finish, and when it's all done
We'll cry glory (glory), oh glory (glory), oh (glory, glory)
We'll cry glory, oh glory, oh (glory, glory)

Selma is now for every man, woman and child
Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now
Never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles
From dark roads he rose, to become a hero
Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people
Enemy is lethal, a king became regal
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle
The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history
No one can win the war individually
It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy
Welcome to the story we call victory
The comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the glory
One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory
(Glory, glory)
Oh (glory, glory)
Oh glory
(Glory, glory)
Yeah (glory, glory)

When the war is won, when it's all said and done
We'll cry glory, oh glory (glory, glory)121Embed","Off the soundtrack to the movie Selma, John Legend & Common’s “Glory” won “Best Original Song” at the 2015 ‪Golden Globe Awards and the 87th Academy Awards.

Inspired by the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches and the Civil Rights Movement in general, Common explained how the song also relates to the recent protests in Ferguson, MO:

I looked at Ferguson and saw what was going on, and knew that it wasn’t far from what was happening during the civil rights movement – people standing up for what they believe in, marching for what they believe in, protesting for what they believe in. We wanted this song to be inspirational. We wanted it to have that pain, but also hope.

Legend expressed a similar sentiment:

I wanted something that tied the spirit of Selma with what was happening in the streets at the time we were writing, which was people protesting in Missouri and eventually New York about injustice and police brutality.

On Jan. 18th 2015, the pair went to Selma to march in celebration of MLK Day even and there they even performed “Glory” live on the Edmund Pettus Bridge:

Ever wonder how freaky Common was? Neither did we, but apparently he’s more than willing to tell us. From a club girl in the bathroom and lyrics reminiscent of a hokey R. Kelly jam to having a threesome with a preacher’s daughter and a girl of her choosing, Common lays it all on the table.

“Go!” was the most successful single off of Be, although it didn’t crack the Billboard Top 40.

Common,Love Is…,"Love Is… Lyrics
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

Yeah, you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep cause on the real he had five kids
Live nig's, real niggas express and taste it
At crap games, black dames and big faces
Cases in court, fam' showing love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again
At least now, now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end, yo
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

It's all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love, hoping it'd become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide, some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Trying to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave
Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave
Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?
Everybody loves sun, why do I attract shade?
Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
What it is to be loved by a man
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

Some say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in, fall in it
With the right companion we all in it
Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
In the game of life, it's the scrimmage
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people, love always, yeah

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me16Embed","“Love Is” is Common’s view on how love was seen in the hood as a young child and through adulthood. it really shows how showing love towards one another was not all that encouraged, nor was it common. However, as written in the song, even the hardest thug around can show emotion, and how that love is all there deep down.

A lot of ya’ll nah nah, forgot now who I am
The '87 nigga used to rah rah in the jam
Aw yeah, we put them things in the air
When I drop a single, it’s really like a pair
Of Air Jordans, important to the culture
If you ain't true to it, cállate la boca
Get my drink on like a coaster
Post up on the wall that Mike used to live off
Hip-hop Master Cleansin', I’mma get my shit off
Rollin’ in a Maserati Gran with the lid off
I bit all like a monster, live nigga this is my encore
Encore, encore, I rhyme for the commoners
My name synonymous with prominence

No I said give 'em that 80′s cocaine
Somethin’ raw, something pure so I stayed in that vein
The hero that he know, that he cold
Like when it's below in the G.O., wipe ya feet off in the Regal
I’m king, observe the throne and the dream
I have it, supreme like mathematics
Yeah, a breath of fresh air for you asthmatic rap addicts
Pro black magic, this is semi-automatic
Rap we won’t jam in traffic
The game need direction, I’m here to map it
Uh, some people say that they be missing creativity
But when it come to hip-hop, it begins and ends with me

You should know who I am nigga

The song itself is a “if a shoe fits, wear it song” (according to Common) shot at “whoever feels it”.

It was produced by No I.D. and samples “You Don’t Have to Worry” by Doris & Kelley.

Driving in a fast lane
Counting mile marker signs
The empty seat beside me
Keeps you on my mind
Livin’ in the heartache
Was never something I pursued
I can’t keep on chasing
What I can’t be for you

Oooh, skies are black and blue
Thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

Tears on a highway
Water in my eyes
This rain ain’t gonna change us
So what’s the use to cry
I could say I’m sorry
But I don’t wanna lie
I just wanna know if staying
Is better than goodbye

Oooh, skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm
Oooh, after all that we’ve been through
There ain’t nothin’ new
Here in the calm after the storm

Maybe I can find you
Down this broken line
Maybe you can find me
I guess we’ll know in time

Oooh, skies are black and blue
Thinking about you

Listen to the wind blow
Coming from a forest land
Chasing every car not every broken avenue
Unlike we do, you and me
Won't you feel the water flow
Down our rivers that will never end
They will never try to understand
Turn the stone into sand as they go-o-oo

Take me back to understand
We deep inside our hearts know
We don't make the wind blow

Look and see the little one
Is running through the rain storms
The dark and the dirt didn't bother us then
Like the long lost friend, I still remember them
Looking up at the Levant stars
We were dancing in an open sky
And with open eyes
And our minds as open

Take me back to understand
We deep inside our hearts know
We don't make the wind blow
Take me back to understand

But your hands still on my shoulder
Much more than a memory
Endless highway bring me home
All I know is that our love goes on
You're in me and in my brothers
Yes and mom still wears your ring
For her there'll never be another
You don't compare to anything
Singing songs while doing dishes
Cracking jokes you filled the room
I miss your laughter and your kisses

When I was younger
And all I had to do
Was hold your hand and drink you in
And make some time for you

I went stumbling through the darkness
Of a thousand half lit bars
I don't now what I was running from
But I must havve run too far

And now I'm reaching
Back for something
But I'm coming
Up with nothing
It's a long long way from where I was to where I am
God have mercy on a runaway man
God have mercy on a runaway man

The porch like you'd left lit
The years dragged on and
Burned away just like a cigaret
The grise of all those nights
Never worth the mornings cost
And oh no a my wishings
It's gonna bring back what I lost

Watch the stars burn out, put the TV on for a while

Like a tune, I could whistle and with luck undo these years

Curled up in your sweater, took your coffee cup
You kiss me awake every time you wake up
There's a piece of my heart that you own, and it may be broken...

And the arms of Orion are taking me there
Got the windows rolled down, to keep me from sleep

Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes
We've got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change
The more they stay the same
Ooh, don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Got to love that afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes
We feel afraid, but it's alright
The more you stay the same
The more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song (Yeah!)
You go ahead, let your hair down (Girl)
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

'Twas more than I could take
Pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake
I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize
That you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Still I wonder why it is

Can't find the words to write this song

Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

At numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science
Science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me

Laying in the grass in the afternoon
Something kind of magical in sunlight
Flowers uncurl in the garden
Shoots are coming up again, it's springtime

It's new like the day I saw your eyes
Green like the leaves unfurling up against a blue sky
Blossom leaf falls in a slow dance
Swaying got me in a trance, so high
It's all green, all new, and I want to spend it with you

Lost in your wonderland
Green aphrodisiac
Kiss me, your lips taste of honey
Songbirds and bees start a-hummin'
Come to my wonderland

The same thing that grows in the garden
Flows in me and you

I want to go where all the rainbows start and flow
Just when I thought it was not to be
Holiest of mysteries, it's all green
And everything that I have planted has grown
And all it needed was time, earth, water, and the sunlight
Down to the middle

Lost in your wonderland

Kiss me, your lips taste of honey
Songbirds and bees start a-hummin'
Come to my wonderland

How could I know you would take over my mind?

Cause I know that
The same thing grows in the garden, flows in me and you

I know what I said was heat
Of the moment
But, there's a little truth in
Between the words we've spoken
It's a little late now to fix a heart
That's broken
Please don't ask me where I'm going

May, I used to hear those violins playing
Harp strings like a symphony
Now they've gone away
Nobody wants to face the truth
But, you won't believe what love can do
Till it happens to you
Till it happens to you

Went to the old flat
Guess I was trying to turn the clock back
But, how come that nothing feels the same now
When I'm with you?
We used to stay up all night in the kitchen when
Our love was new
Ooh love am I a fool to believe in you
Cause I don't know, no I don't know anymore
It used feel like heaven, it used feel like may
I used hear those violins playing harp strings
Like a symphony now there gone away
Nobody wants to know the truth until their
Hearts broken

Shalalala la la la
Uh huh

I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful
So come dance this silence down through the morning
Shalalala la la la la, yeah..
Uh huh, yeah.. Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of them Spanish dances
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me, help me believe in anything
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes, yeah

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me.""
Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely
Well, I'm gonna paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso, I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you. I don't think so. She's looking at me.""
Standing in the spotlight, I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely
I'll never be lonely
Said I'm never gonna be lonely

I want to be a lion
Yeah, everybody wants to pass as cats
We all want to be big, big stars, yeah
But we got different reasons for that
Believe in me, 'cause I don't believe in anything
And I, I want to be someone to believe
To believe, to believe, yeah!
Mr. Jones and me, stumbling through the barrio
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
""She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me.""
I want to be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody loves you, ah son
That's just about as funky as you can be

Mr. Jones and me, staring at the video
When I look at the television, I want to see me
Staring right back at me
We all want to be big stars
But we don't know why, and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I want to be just about as happy as I can be

Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars18Embed","“It’s really a song about my friend Marty and I. We went out one night to watch his dad play, his dad was a Flamenco guitar player who lived in Spain, and he was in San Francisco in the Mission playing with his old Flamenco troupe. And after the gig we all went to this bar called the New Amsterdam in San Francisco on Columbus and we got completely drunk. And Marty and I sat at the bar staring at these two girls, wishing there was some way we could go talk to them, but we were too shy. We kept joking with each other that if we were big rock stars instead of such loser, low-budget musicians, this would be easy. I went home that night and I wrote a song about it”

That is the literal meaning behind it, but the more subtle meaning has to do with dreams and what motivates us to do what we do.","December 1, 1993"

Counting Crows,Round Here,"Round Here Lyrics
Step out the front door like a ghost into a fog
Where no one notices the contrast of white on white
In between the moon and you, the angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right
Well, I walk in the air between the rain
Through myself and back again
Where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying
Through the door, I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

'Round here, we always stand up straight
'Round here, something radiates

Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
And she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house and takes her clothes off
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous
'Round here, we're carving out our names
'Round here, we all look the same
'Round here, we talk just like lions but we sacrifice like lambs
'Round here, she's slipping though my hands

Sleeping children better run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning

She says, ""It's only in my head""
She says, ""Shh, I know it's only in my head""
But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Says, ""Man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling?""
Then she looks up at the building
And says she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life
She must be tired of something

'Round here, she's always on my mind
'Round here, hey man, got lots of time
Round here, we're never sent to bed early
Man, nobody makes us wait
'Round here we stay up very, very, very, very late
I, I can't see nothing, nothing 'round here
You catch me if I'm falling, you catch me if I'm falling
Will you catch me? 'Cause I'm falling down on you

I said I'm under the gun 'round here
Oh man, I said I'm under the gun 'round here
Well I can't see nothing, nothing 'round here12Embed","This song was originally performed by The Himalayans, a band comprised of Adam Duritz, Dave Janusko, Dan Jewett, Marty Jones and Chris Roldan.



Duritz explained why he wrote this song in a 1999 concert in Amsterdam

We wrote this song in 1989 … We were all in bands and we had shitty jobs. We would wash dishes, work in record stores and wash windows and … by day, so that we can be in a rock and roll band at night. You know? And it was after college and our friends are getting on with their lives. And they had good jobs, well… boring jobs… but they all had more money than we did, and they had futures and we didn’t. There comes a point in the life of everyone in a rock and roll band that you have to sort of decide, am I going to do this with my life, or am I going to go get one of those other jobs? Because I can’t deal with washing dishes anymore and I can’t dig any more holes, and I can’t wash another window. And there is those that go, and there is those that stay. And you walk out on the edge of the world and you balance yourself there for a while and you try to figure out just which one you’re gonna be. And a lot of our friends are doing other things right now. And we’re standing right up here on this stage.","September 14, 1993"

Counting Crows,A Long December,"A Long December Lyrics
A long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leaving
Now the days go by so fast

And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think that I could be forgiven
I wish you would

The smell of hospitals in winter
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
All at once, you look across a crowded room
To see the way that light attaches to a girl

And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think you might come to California
I think you should

Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after 2 A.M
And talked a little while about the year
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower
Makes you talk a little lower
About the things you could not show her
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself
To hold on to these moments as they pass

And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean
I guess I should9Embed","“A Long December” is the Counting Crows hit single off of their second album “Recovering the Satellites”

Despite being on the original demo that got them signed in 1990, their record label chose to hold off on releasing “Linger” as a single until 1993, after both a 1991 EP and a their debut single “Dreams” in 1992 had come out. However, it wasn’t until MTV added the video into rotation in late 1993 while they were touring with Suede (Known as London Suede in the US) that it was reissued and became a top 40 hit in five countries, launching the band into international stardom in 1994. It remains the Cranberries only top 10 hit and only gold selling single in the US.

Dolores O'Riordan has said that the song was written about her first boyfriend and “being broken-hearted by a love situation. You love somebody but they reject you”. The music was written before she joined the band, and her lyrics replaced the pre-existing ones written by the group’s previous vocalist.","February 23, 1993"

So, “Dreams” was then reissued and found chart success.

The Cranberries,Ode to My Family,"Ode to My Family Lyrics
Understand the things I say
Don't turn away from me
Cause I've spent half my life out there
You wouldn't disagree

Do you see me, do you see?
Do you like me
Do you like me standing there?
Do you notice, do you know
Do you see me, do you see me?
Does anyone care?

Unhappiness where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
Cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can
My mother, my mother
She'd hold me
She'd hold me when I was out there
My father, my father
He liked me, well he liked me
Does anyone care?
Understand what I've become
It wasn't my design
And people everywhere think
Something better than I am

But I miss you, I miss
Cause I liked it
Cause I liked it
When I was out there
Do you know this, do you know
You did not find me
You did not find

In a white room with black curtains near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment
I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves
You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning
I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings
I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves
17Embed","A rock song written by a bona fide poet, “White Room” was released first in 1968 on the album Wheels of Fire, and then as a single later that same year. It was one of several fruitful collaborations between Cream bassist Jack Bruce and poet Pete Brown.

Pete Brown later joked, “It was a miracle it worked, considering it was me writing a monologue about a new flat.”

Brown was being a bit modest; in reality, he was having a bit of an existential crisis about whether or not to continue writing lyrics for music or to return to focusing on poetry.

Brown had the poem on hand when Jack Bruce rejected his earlier attempt:

The music was written first. I had one stab at a lyric that had nothing to do with the final song. It was called “Cinderella’s Last Goodnight” – it was about some doomed hippie girl. Jack didn’t like it, which was fair enough. Then I found this eight-page poem I’d written that had things about white rooms and other stuff in it. I worked that into a lyric that went with the atmosphere and meter of the song.

Aside from Brown’s lyricism, another notable feature of the song is Eric Clapton’s blazing guitar solo on the song’s outro. He adopted a wah-wah pedal to emulate Jimi Hendrix’s style. The solo was rated by Guitar World as the #2 solo of all time—just behind Jimi Hendrix’s on Voodoo Child.

The combination of Clapton’s axe and Brown’s pen worked—Cream hit #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 with White Room, a sign of their growing following in the US. It would prove to be the band’s last major hit, though: they broke up in late 1968.","January 1, 1968"

It was the first single of their Wheels of Fire record in 1968 and featured a live video of the track. A portion of Johnson’s “Travelling Riverside Blues” also exists in the song.

The lyrical intent has been debated over the years, with some saying it signifies selling your soul to the devil, while Samuel Charters, noted Blues historian, see’s a racial angle, with references to racial segregation in the second verse.

Clapton has used the name “Crossroads” repeatedly in his life since this release. His Greatest Hits release was titled Crossroads, and he created the Crossroads Guitar Festival in 2004, to help benefit his Crossroads Centre, an institution to help with drug addiction in Antigua.",1968

Harrison had scribbled ‘bridge’ to indicate where the bridge of the song would begin on his hand-written sheet music, and as Clapton couldn’t read George’s handwriting, he thought it said “Badge.” The two laughed about it, and consequently, the title stuck.

The lyrics themselves are not intended to make sense; many of them were taken from drunken conversations Harrison had with Ringo Starr.

Although it was officially a Cream song, the songwriting credits list both Eric Clapton and George Harrison.  Due to contractual reasons however, George Harrison is credited under the pseudonym L'Angelo Misterioso, and it is believed that Harrison played on the track as in return for Clapton playing on The Beatles' track “While My Guitar Gently Weeps”.",February 1969

Would bring you down forever
But you rode upon a steamer
To the violence of the sun

And the colors of the sea
Bind your eyes with trembling mermaids
And you touch the distant beaches
With tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing
For the sparkling waves are calling you
To kiss their white laced lips

And you see a girl's brown body
Dancing through the turquoise
And her footprints make you follow
Where the sky loves the sea
And when your fingers find her
She drowns you in her body
Carving deep blue ripples
In the tissues of your mind
The tiny purple fishes
Run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you
To the hard land of the winter

Her name is Aphrodite
And she rides a crimson shell
And you know you cannot leave her
For you touched the distant sands
With tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing

The tiny purple fishes
Run lauging through your fingers
And you want to take her with you
To the hard land of the winter

It shows a little of their blues background, their pop nature and quite a bit of psychedelic influence.

“I Feel Free” was the first song on the American version of Cream’s first album, Fresh Cream, considered to be a pioneering influence on heavy metal, although the real blues power of the band didn’t come out completely until their next two albums.

This song marks the debut of Eric Clapton’s famous “Woman Tone” – caused by Clapton turning his amp to maximum volume, boosting the treble and cutting the bass out entirely. Clapton played this song on a borrowed Les Paul, as his famous “Beano” guitar had been stolen during the Fresh Cream rehearsals.

Clapton was actually quite disappointed with his guitar work on this song, fighting with Jack Bruce to re-record it. Unfortunately, the song was recorded straight onto reel-to-reel tape, making any retakes extremely difficult – plus, Bruce loved the first take so much he refused any attempt to re-do it.

The song remains one of their most popular – it’s been covered by many artists, including David Bowie, Belinda Carlisle, Foo Fighters and Delta Spirit.","December 1, 1966"

As John Fogerty put it:

“Julie Nixon was hanging around with David Eisenhower, and you just had the feeling that none of these people were going to be involved with the war. In 1968, the majority of the country thought morale was great among the troops, and eighty percent of them were in favor of the war. But to some of us who were watching closely, we just knew we were headed for trouble.”

As explained by John Fogerty, this song is the birthchild in a time of extreme distrust for executive authority. John describes the callousness of then president Richard Nixon and his arrogance towards young people.

Back in the fall of 1967 — before the release of our first Creedence album — I bought a small notebook and began keeping a list of song-title ideas. My first entry was “Proud Mary.” I didn’t really know what those two words meant but I liked how they sounded together.

At the time, I was living in an apartment in Albany, California, near San Francisco, with my wife at the time and our newborn son. I was still in the Army Reserve and was concerned about being sent to Vietnam. One day in the early summer of ‘68, I saw an oversize envelope on the steps of our apartment building. It was my honorable discharge. In the blink of an eye, I was a civilian again. I did a handstand and flipped a few times on the small lawn out front.

Then I went inside, picked up my Rickenbacker guitar and began playing a song intro I had been working on. The chord riff was based on the opening to Beethoven’s “Fifth Symphony,” which I had first heard on TV growing up. I didn’t like how Beethoven had composed it. I preferred hitting the first chord hard for emphasis, not the fourth.

When I added rhythm to the chords, the song had the motion of a boat. I had always loved Mark Twain’s writing and the music of Stephen Foster, so I wrote lyrics about a riverboat. The line “rollin' on the river” was influenced by a movie I once saw about two riverboats racing. I finished most of it in two hours. Then I opened my notebook for a song title. There was “Proud Mary.”

A few weeks later, I played the song for the band. We had been rehearsing in my brother Tom’s garage in nearby El Cerrito. I showed them how the song went, but for a period of days it didn’t sound right. So I wrote out music parts for everyone.

When we recorded the tracks at RCA Studios in Hollywood in October ‘68, I channeled Wilson Pickett and Howlin' Wolf with my lead vocal. Just as we were extending the final chorus at the end of the last and best take, the 2-inch reel of tape ran out. Luckily we had enough on there to create a fade-out in the final mix.

Listening to the playback, I wasn’t happy. The band’s background vocals sounded abrasive — like punk rock, not harmonious. I wanted a gospel feel. When I told the guys I was going to overdub the vocal harmony tracks myself, we had a big fight. Bruce Young, our road manager, took them to dinner.

I stayed behind and overdubbed all the background vocal parts. I also overdubbed a guitar solo using a Gibson ES-175—a big jazz guitar that I bought for the recording session. I recorded my solo line twice so it sounded more pronounced.

At the restaurant later, the guys were still angry and threatened to quit. I convinced them to hear the results. Back at the studio, I played them the song with my vocals. Nobody said anything. Then Bruce said, “Wow.” The single came out in January ‘69 and topped out at No. 2 on Billboard’s pop chart in March for three weeks. The band eventually broke up in '72.


That’s right: John Fogerty says he wasn’t into Beethoven’s composition of the Fifth. Whoosh.","January 1, 1969"

The song reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in September 1969.

Lead singer and songwriter John Fogerty told Team Rock that the name “Bad Moon Rising” came from a book of song titles that he kept. he said, “I didn’t even know what it meant, I just liked how the words sounded.”

The lyrics were inspired by a 1941 black-and-white film Fogerty had watched called The Devil and Daniel Webster.
He said,

The scene I liked is where there’s a devastating hurricane; furniture, trees, houses, everything’s blowing around. That story and that look really stuck in my mind and they were the germ for the song.

Fogerty allegedly wrote the song the same day Richard Nixon was elected president—he denies the song has a political subtext. However, the song still became an anthem both for troops in Vietnam and anti-war protestors across the country.

Fogerty acknowledges the song’s political undercurrent:

The song was a metaphor. I wasn’t just writing about the weather. The times seemed to be in turmoil. Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy had been assassinated. I knew it was a tumultuous time.","August 5, 1969"

Over by the courthouse, they're starting to unwind

Down on the corner, out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Rooster hits the washboard, and people just got to smile
Blinky thumps the gut bass and solos for a while
Poor boy twangs the rhythm out on his Kalamazoo
Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo

He said this about the song:

I was talking about America and the proliferation of guns. I’m a hunter and I’m not anti-gun, but I just thought that people were so gun-happy – and there were so many guns that it really was dangerous.“
(It’s even worse now.)



Fogerty was later sued by the record company for his The Old Man Down the Road, with the company claiming it sounded too much like Run Through the Jungle. Fogerty won because he performed both songs and it was determined that a man cannot plagiarize himself.","July 25, 1970"

There is freedom within, there is freedom without

But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

Only shadows ahead, barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

In the bar of a small town hotel
And you asked me what I was thinking

With a black and white T.V
To stop us from getting lonely

“It was two songs we flung together in LA. The verse was written on a tour of New Zealand I did with Dave Dobbyn under the absolutely shocking moniker of the Party Boys.

We played Palmerston North and this girl turned up from America. She’d written to my parents to say she was coming to New Zealand, was a massive Split Enz fan, would it be possible for me to meet her, it would be the fulfilment of a dream. A really over-the-top letter.

I met her and had 10 minutes with her. Then I came back later and she was dancing with Gary McCormick, so I wrote those lines in which I did intimate they’d got it on. She bailed me up in LA about three years later and was most upset. She swears she didn’t. I felt chastened by that. """,June 1986

The temperature could drop away
Like four seasons in one day

Smiling as the shit comes down
You can tell a man from what he has to say
Everything gets turned around
And I will risk my neck again, again

You can take me where you will
Up the creek and through the mill
Like all the things you can't explain
Four seasons in one day

Blood dries up
Like rain, like rain
Fills my cup
Like four seasons in one day
It doesn't pay to make predictions
Sleeping on an unmade bed
Finding out wherever there is comfort there is pain
Only one step away

Where your words devour my heart

Old enough to know who you are
Wise enough to carry the scars
Without any blame, there's no one to blame

Waiting for the thrill to return
Feeling your desire burn
You're drawn to the flame

Will shower over everyone

Will shower over everyone

And I'm lying on the table, washed out in the flood
Like a Christian fearing vengeance from above
I don't pretend to know what you want, but I offer love

Lovers never ask you why

Wrapped in sorrow, words are token

Like most songs on it, “Hurt” was written by Boy George primarily about his relationship with drummer Jon Moss. The band had come up with the melody during some spare time while recording for The Peter Powell show on BBC Radio One.

After the band’s previous two singles made little impact, their label wanted to release “Hurt” as the group’s last chance to find success. George did not want the record label to send it to radio as a single because not only did he feel it was too personal, but “it wasn’t club music” – threatening to leave the band if they did so. The label moved forward anyway, but things continued to look fruitless at first, with an early review in Smash Hits calling the song “weak, watered-down fourth division reggae”.

After Shakin' Stevens canceled his appearance on the popular UK music show Top Of The Pops, Culture Club was asked to fill in. George’s controversial cross-dressing look filled the newspapers and airwaves the next day with statements like ‘Is it a boy, is it a girl?’ and ‘What is that thing?!’ The massive publicity of the performance helped launch the song up to the #1 spot in the UK for three consecutive weeks.

“Hurt” also topped the chart in several other countries around the world, and reached #2 in several more – including the US in March 1983 where it was held from the top spot for three weeks by Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean”. Within a few months, the band were international stars.

Its music video, showing George being not accepted in various scenarios, including a courtroom with a jury in blackface, was in heavy rotation on MTV in the US. Director Julien Temple explained it was:

…about being gay and being victimized for your sexuality, which George was kind of emblematic of. It seemed appropriate to me that in the video he would be judged by jurors in blackface, to send up bigotry and point out the hypocrisy of the many gay judges and politicians in the UK who’d enacted anti-gay legislation.

Soon after, their follow-up single “Time” also shot into the top 20 in several countries around the world, and the band would eventually reach the top 5 in the UK seven times before their breakup in 1986.

George has stated that despite the outward appearance that the song was written about S&M, it was simply about emotional pain. But in an “apparently accidental allusion” to this song, while he was being tried for handcuffing a male escort and hitting him with a chain in 2009, the prosecution asked the jury, “Did he really have to hurt him?”","September 6, 1982"

""Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream"", she said
""The one that makes me laugh"", she said
And threw her arms around my neck
""Show me how you do it, and I promise you
I promise that I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you""

Spinning on that dizzy edge
Kissed her face and kissed her head
Dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow
""Why are you so far away?"", she said
""Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?""

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream
Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, just like heaven51Embed","“Just Like Heaven” was the third single from Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me It was inspired by a trip Robert Smith took with his then-girlfriend (future wife) Mary Poole to Beachy Head at East Sussex. Smith told Blender in 2003:

The song is about hyperventilating – kissing and fainting to the floor. Mary dances with me in the video because she was the girl, so it had to be her. The idea is that one night like that is worth 1,000 hours of drudgery.

“Just Like Heaven” was The Cure’s first top 40 hit in the US. It also reached the top 40 in France, New Zealand and the UK. In the summer of 1992, Smith called it “the best pop song the Cure has ever done.”","October 5, 1987"
The Cure,Friday I’m in Love,"Friday I’m in Love Lyrics
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey, and Wednesday too
Thursday, I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday, you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love

Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday, heart attack
Thursday, never looking back
It's Friday, I'm in love


Monday, you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed
Or Thursday, watch the walls instead
It's Friday, I'm in love
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

Dressed up to the eyes
It's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
And just smiling at the sound
As sleek as a shriek
Spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday, I'm in love!

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey, and Wednesday too
Thursday, I don't care about you

It is the Cure’s second highest-charting song in Ireland (#4), the UK (#6), New Zealand (#7) and the US (#18). It also topped the Modern Rock Chart in the US for four weeks.


I mean, ‘Friday, I’m In Love’ is not a work of genius, it was almost a calculated song. It’s a really good chord progression, I couldn’t believe no-one else had used it and I asked so many people at the time – I was getting drug paranoia anyway – ‘I must have stolen this from somewhere, I can’t possibly have come up with this.’ I asked everyone I knew, everyone.
- Robert Smith

“‘Friday I’m in Love’ is a dumb pop song, but it’s quite excellent actually, because it’s so absurd. It’s so out of character – very optimistic and really out there in happy land. It’s nice to get that counterbalance. People think we’re supposed to be leaders of some sort of ‘gloom movement.’ I could sit and write gloomy songs all day long, but I just don’t see the point.” – Robert Smith, Spin Magazine, June 1992","May 11, 1992"

“Lovesong” was the second UK and third US single from Disintegration, The Cure’s eighth studio album, and is the band’s highest charting single in the United States, reaching #2 in late 1989.

Despite the song’s enormous success, Smith has mixed feelings about the track. He expresses satisfaction in finally feeling comfortable enough to write a straightforward love song and feels the song keeps Disintegration from having only one mood – presumably “gloom”. However, he called it the weakest song on the album and expressed disappointment that it was the band’s breakthrough single in the US.

Notable cover versions:


Rock band 311 covered the song for the film 50 First Dates

Singer-songwriter Adele covered it on her sophomore album 21

Rock band Anberlin covered it on their 2003 debut album Blueprints for the Black Market.","May 2, 1989"

If I thought that it would change your mind

I have said too much, been too unkind

I tried to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I tried to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would break down at your feet
And beg forgiveness, plead with you
But I know that it's too late
And now there's nothing I can do

So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry
I would tell you that I loved you
If I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's no use
And you've already gone away

Misjudged your limits
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted
I thought that you needed me more, more, more

Now I would do 'most anything
To get you back by my side
But I just keep on laughing
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry

On original release, it only found chart success in New Zealand, reaching #22 in May 1980.

The Cure,Pictures of You,"Pictures of You Lyrics

I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel

Remembering you standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close
How I always held close in your fear

Remembering you running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go

Remembering you fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white, so delicate, lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you, how you used to be
Slow drowned, you were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes, but I never see anything

If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
And always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
All my pictures of you22Embed","“Pictures Of You” is the fourth and final single released from Disintegration. It reached the top 30 in the UK and Germany, and was a minor hit in the US and The Netherlands.

Smith has given different stories about what inspired the song. One is that it was written after a fire at Smith’s house and he found pictures of his wife, Mary Poole in the wreckage – so the song was written in response to his nostalgia. Another story is that he once threw away all of his personal photos and home movies.

Yet another tale, found in the liner notes for the band’s compilation album Galore, Smith wrote that the song was “loosely based on an essay by Myra Poleo entitled The Dark Power of Ritual Pictures – after reading it I destroyed all my old ‘personal’ photographs, and almost all of my ‘home’ cine and video collection – I think I was trying to wipe away my past… within days I was suffering great regret; I still am!”

However, the name Myra Poleo is an anagram of his wife’s maiden name Mary Poole, and no such poem has been found to exist. It must also be taken into consideration that Smith confessed to Smash News in 1985 that he lies to interviewers because “I bore myself if I don’t make things up.”

The photo on the cover of the song’s single is the same one used as the cover of “Charlotte Sometimes”, just not heavily distorted. Smith believes it was taken in Scotland in 1981 while on holiday.

The lyrics continue the atmospheric imagery of “Plainsong”, tying in the theme of  rain. Its music video shows the band in the snow dressed in winter clothing as it is revealed they are actually in the tropics surrounded by palm trees, a concept also found in their 1987 b-side “Snow In Summer”.","May 2, 1989"
The Cure,Lullaby,"Lullaby Lyrics
I spy with the corner of my little eye
Something beginning with 'S'

On candy-stripe legs the spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realise with fright
That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering, furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the spiderman is always hungry
""Come into my parlor,"" said the spider to the fly
""I have a little something here""33Embed","“Lullaby” was the first single from Disintegration overseas. It was originally going to be the first US single as well, but as Smith explained, “We were on a film soundtrack (Lost Angels) with ‘Fascination Street’, so we put that out in America instead”.

It is the band’s highest charting single in their home country – their only to reach the top 5 in the UK – and reached the top 30 in eight more countries overseas. In the US, it peaked at #74.

Tim Pope, the song’s music video director and frequent collaborator with The Cure, interprets the song as an allegory for Robert Smith’s drug-laden past. The video won the ‘Best Video’ award at the 1990 BRIT Awards.

The song was inspired by an uncle who told songwriter Robert Smith scary stories at bedtime about a “spiderman” who ate children, as he explains about 40 seconds into the video clip below.

Just try to make it work

In 1990, “Close To Me” was remixed for Mixed Up by Paul Oakenfold and released again as a single. That version reached #13 in the UK and #97 in the US.","September 17, 1985"

Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this

The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle

I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake

Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

“Unshaken” is a song that appears in Red Dead Redemption 2 at the gang’s lowest point. During a ride to Shady Belle, Arthur is left to reflect on what he has gone through, with the song suggesting he hopes to remain strong after losing so much.

The first of several points in Red Dead where the music becomes the main focus; this emphasis accompanied with the long, solitary ride feels a lot like its own version of the famous “Far Away” scene from the first game.

A reprised version of the song appears at a pivotal moment, at the end of chapter 6.","January 4, 2019"

How does it feel?12Embed","“Untitled (How Does It Feel)” became notorious for its sexually charged video featuring a series of lingering shots of D'Angelo’s nude body that split the difference between mass voyeurism and personal intimacy.

However, the rapturous intensity in his lushly multi-tracked vocal performance still holds more weight than any pin-up shot could—swooping and diving, gliding smoothly over the sway of the beat only to punctuate it with a sharp hitch or an extension of his deceptively delicate falsetto into an intense wail. The musical backing only adds to that euphoria, with gospel-soul pianos direct from Aretha’s Muscle Shoals sessions intertwined with pre-Dirty Mind (but still dirty-minded) Prince guitars.

“Untitled (How Does It Feel)” was released as the third single from Voodoo and peaked at #2 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.","January 25, 2000"

D’Angelo,Devil’s Pie,"Devil’s Pie Lyrics
Mm
Fuck the slice, want the pie
Why ask why 'til we fry
Watch us all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie
Drugs and thugs, women, wine
Three or four at a time
Watch them all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie

Who am I to justify
All the evil in our eye
When I myself feel the high
From all that I despise?
Behind the jail or in the grave
I have to lay in this bed I made
And if I die before I wake
I hope the Lord don't hesitate
To get to heaven, went through hell
Tell my peeps all is well
All them fools whose soul's for sale
Sitting next to the Jezebel
Demons screamin' in my ear
All my anger, all my fear
If I holler, let them hear
In this spinning sphere
Fuck the slice, want the pie
Why ask why 'til we fry
Watch us all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie
Drugs and thugs, women, wine
Three or four at a time
Watch them all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie

Main ingredients (Uh) to this dish (Yeah)
Goes like this, here's the list
Materialistic, greed and lust, jealousy, envious
Bread and dough, cheddar cheese
Flash and stash, cash and cream
Temperature's at a high degree
Where niggas come to feast
Hell is this all about?
Apocalypse, ain't no doubt
Everybody's ho'ing out
All the loot, all the clout
Right or wrong, do or die
Only vengeance could pacify
Watch your back and so will I
In these days and time
Fuck the slice, want the pie
Why ask why 'til we fry
Watch us all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie
Drugs and thugs, women, wine
Three or four at a time
Watch them all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie

Oh, woah-woah-woah-woah
Oh
Oh-oh-oh, woah-woah-woah
Ah
Ain't no justice, it's just us
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Time has come for most of us
To choose in which God we trust
I know I was born to die
Searching to find a peace of mind
With eighty-five, dumb and blind
There can be no compromise

Fuck the slice (Yeah), want the pie (Uh)
Why ask why 'til we fry ('Til we gon' fry)

In the song, DMX asserts his power, telling everyone to stay away from him and not pick a fight with him, or else he’ll “give it to ya!”

The song received renewed attention in 2015 after being featured in a trailer for Deadpool (eventually appearing in the movie itself, given ‘X’ also fits ‘X-Men’), and in the hit animated series Rick and Morty.","February 18, 2003"

At the time of the song’s release, DMX was coming off of two number one albums, It’s Dark And Hell Is Hot and Flesh Of My Blood, Blood Of My Blood. Sisqo had recently released “Thong Song” which went on to become one of the biggest and most memorable songs of the year. The single art for “What These Bitches Want” features a picture of DMX with the lines, “The Biggest in Rap meets The Biggest in R&B.”



In the song, DMX raps about the various women in his life—the second verse is almost entirely dedicated to listing the names of women he has been involved with, matched with those classic DMX “what” shouts in the background.","June 13, 2000"
DMX,Ruff Ryders’ Anthem,"Ruff Ryders’ Anthem Lyrics

Uh
Something new

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie
Then niggas wonder why niggas wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain with that shit on my brain?
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is, New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is with it, you want it? Come and get it
Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew, don't know what we goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
Lemme find out there's some more niggas that's runnin' with your niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight then you haven't met the apes
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

Is y'all niggas crazy? I'll bust you and be Swayze
Stop actin' like a baby, mind your business, lady
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah I know, it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down, watch my niggas spit rounds
Make y'all niggas kiss ground just for talkin' shit, clown
Oh, you think it's funny? Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean, come up off that green
Rob niggas on Ravine, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
And, yo, I'm a slave 'til my home is the grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Look what you done started, asked for it, you got it
Had it, shoulda shot it, now you're dearly departed
Get at me, dawg, did I rip shit? With this one here I flip shit
Niggas know when I kick shit it's gon' be some slick shit
What was that look for when I walked in the door?
Oh, you thought you was raw? Boom, not anymore
'Cause now you on the floor wishin' you never saw
Me walk through that door with that four-four
Now it's time for bed, two more to the head
Got the floor red, yeah, that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, it's goin' down in history
Niggas ain't never did shit to me, bitch-ass niggas can't get to me
Gots to make a move, got a point to prove
Gotta make 'em groove, got 'em all like, ""Ooh""
So 'til the next time you hear this nigga rhyme
Try to keep your mind on gettin' pussy and crime

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop

Talk is cheap, motherfucker!129Embed","“Ruff Ryders' Anthem”, released as a B-side to “Slippin'”, was the fourth and final single from the album, and peaked at #93 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1998. After DMX’s death on April 9, 2021, the song re-entered the Hot 100 and reached a new peak of #16, the week ending April 15, 2021. VH1 ranked it #79 on their list of greatest hip hop songs.

Producer Swizz Beatz provided some background information on the track in an interview with Complex:


I made the ‘Ruff Ryders Anthem’ beat in Atlanta. It was me just bugging out, having my New York influence and having my Atlanta influence. That track was the perfect blend which was awkward and different at the time because nobody had ever heard anything like that—including my clique.

DMX didn’t want to do it. He was like, ‘Man, that sounds like some rock ‘n’ roll track, I need some hip-hop shit. I’m not doing that. It’s not hood enough.’ I told him, ‘Yo, we can make it hood!’ […] Then he came in and did it and we were just hyping him up. The ‘What!’ ad-lib and all of that came about in the middle of us hyping him up. We left it in the track to add energy. Collectively, we came up with that vibe. It was his best shit at that time. Since then, X has trusted my judgment.


The background vocals and beat follow the rhythm of a military cadence. This reflects on the hook’s theme of being a cohesive unit.","May 5, 1998"
DMX,Party Up (Up In Here),"Party Up (Up In Here) Lyrics
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

If I gots to bring it to you cowards, then it's gonna be quick (Aight)
All your mans that been to jail before, suck my dick
And all them other cats you run with, get done with dumb quick
How the fuck you gon' cross the dog on some bum shit? (Aight)
There go the gun click, 911 shit
All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit?
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club
'Cause every time you come around, it's like what?
I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin' to
But I'm not him, aight, Slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue
Or maybe they just saying that now 'cause they miss you
Shit, a nigga tried to diss you
That's why you laying on your back
Looking at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin' the truth and it hurts
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

Off the chain, I leave niggas soft in the brain
'Cause niggas still want the fame off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fucking with me, and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on
That got you think that you Superman, I got the Kryptonite
Should I smack him with my dick or the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? (Hmm), let's add up all the factors
You wack, you twisted, your girl's a ho
You broke, the kid ain't yours and everybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, ""So?""
""I love my baby mother, I'll never let her go""
I'm tired of weak-ass niggas whining over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it all on the strength of the hands with them, man
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

I bring down rain so heavy it hurts the head
No more talking, put him in the dirt instead
You keep walking, 'less you tryna end up red
'Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
'Cause you's a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Get pushed like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brung out
Run up in there, everybody come out, don't nobody burn out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga running his mouth, I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, your ass is about to be missin'
You know who gon' find you? (Who?), some old man fishin'
Grandma wishin' your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

One, two, meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my Ruff Ryders gon' meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my big ballers gon' meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my fly ladies gon' meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my street-street people, meet me outside
Meet me outside, outside, motherfucker

Producer Swizz Beatz talked about the track in an interview with Complex


That’s our biggest record, globally. ‘Party Up’ was at a time when things were moving fast. X was probably frustrated coming to the studio that day like, ‘Y’all gone make me lose my mind!’ A lot of the stuff we were doing was in the moment. When he says, ‘Y’all gone make me lose my mind!’ it’s probably what he was really feeling.

So we said, ‘You’re not the only person who feels like that. Everybody feels like that.’ We took that frustration and excitement and put it into a hit song. […] I just went in there bugging out. I didn’t think they would keep the ‘One, two, meet me outside.’

DMX,Slippin’,"Slippin’ Lyrics
This life shit, this life shit is like
Is like bugged the fuck out, son, for real
See, to live is to suffer
But to survive
Well, that's to find meaning in the suffering

Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

I've been through mad different phases like mazes to find my way
And now I know that happy days are not far away
If I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids
Doin' somethin' more constructive with their time than bids
I know because I been there, now I'm in there
Sit back and look at what it took for me to get there
First came the bullshit, the drama with my mama
She got on some fly shit so I split and said that I'ma
Be that seed that doesn't need much to succeed
Strapped with mad greed and a heart that doesn't bleed
I'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was
Baggin' niggas when I caught a buzz
For thinkin' about how short I was
Goin' too fast, it wouldn't last, but yo I couldn't tell
Group homes and institutions prepared my ass for jail
They put me in a situation forcin' me to be a man
When I was just learnin' to stand without a helping hand
Damn, was it my fault, somethin' I did
To make a father leave his first kid at seven doin' my first bid?
Back on the scene at fourteen with a scheme
To get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream
And by all means I will be livin' high off the hog
And I never gave a fuck about much but my dog
That's my only mothafucka I hit off with my last
Just another lil nigga headed nowhere fast
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

That ain't the half, shit gets worse as I get older
Actions become bolder, heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch
Didn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much
One deep with the pit startin' shit for kicks
Catchin' vics, throwin' bricks, gettin' by bein' slick
Used to get high, just to get by
Used to have to puff my L in the morning before I could fly
Ate somethin', a couple of forties made me hate somethin'
I did some coke, now I'm ready to take somethin'
Three years later showin' signs of stress
Didn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed
I'm possessed by the darker side, livin' the cruddy life
Shit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
Wanna make records but I'm fuckin' it up
I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Wasn't long before I hit rock bottom
Niggas talkin' shit, like, ""Damn, look how that rock got him!""
Open like a window, no more indo
Look at a video, sayin' to myself: ""That coulda been yo
Ass on the TV,"" believe me, it could be done
Somethin's got to give, gots to change 'cause now I've got a son
I gots to do the right thing for shorty
And that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s
So I get back lookin' type slick again
Fake niggas jump back on my dick again
Nothin' but love for those that know how it feel
And much respect to all my niggas that kept it real
Kept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doin' wrong
Niggas know who they is and this is your fuckin' song
And to my boo who stuck with a nigga through
All the bullshit, you'll get yours because it's due
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

See, this is that shit, this is that shit
That all real niggas can relate to
This is from the heart, baby
Don't get it twisted

Uh83Embed","”How’s It Going Down” is a 1998 DMX single featuring R&B star Faith Evans on the intro.

It tells the story of an affair he has with a woman who has kids—and the father is still around.  He questions whether the two seek the same type of relationship.

The girl’s jealous lover attacks a man he thinks is DMX, but it’s a case of mistaken identity.

Eventually, DMX gives up the whole affair, even though the sex is hot—he feels wrong about breaking up her family. It’s a pretty sweet ending to the story, from a man who says he’s ”not a nice person.”","May 12, 1998"

And the stars look very different today

For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world

And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much

92Embed","‘Major Tom’ is a fictional character created by David Bowie for this song in 1969. That same year marked the first moon landing, so space was “in”; this was a year after Stanley Kubrick’s film 2001: A Space Odyssey, co-written with Arthur C. Clarke.

The song is a “lost in space” story, which generated later more songs and sequels about the character by David Bowie (“Ashes to Ashes” and “Hallo Spaceboy”) and even other artists (Peter Schilling’s 1983 “Major Tom (coming home)”, (K.I.A.’s “Mrs Major Tom” and possibly Elton John’s “Rocket Man”. The last one is also produced by Gus Dudgeon, who filled in for Bowie’s usual collaborator Tony Visconti once he refused to work in “Space Oddity” feeling it was a novelty song, a publicity stunt to cash in to the Apollo missions (“this is not ‘Space Oddity’, it’s Ernie The Milkman”).

Many believe that the song describes a drug (heroin) trip, from “lift-off” to “floating” to being “still” with “circuit’s dead” ending in “nothing I can do”.","July 11, 1969"

And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day

We can be heroes

We can be heroes just for one day

We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day

I thought, of all the places to meet in Berlin, why pick a bench underneath a guard turret on the Wall?

https://youtu.be/VudyGkGWDlc?t=179

Wanting to stop his friend’s affair from coming to his wife’s attention, Bowie anonymised the song, and filled in details from his imagination. As Rolling Stone put it, “Bowie wails with crazed soul about two doomed lovers finding a moment of redemption together — just for one day.”

The song was written with Brian Eno, who plays a droning EMS VCS3. Robert Fripp of King Crimson plays guitar with pitched feedback, whilst Tony Visconti produced Bowie’s finest vocal performance by moving the microphone away from him as the song progressed, forcing him to shout just to be heard.

The song was not initially popular, but is now widely considered one of Bowie’s best. It is frequently played at sporting events and awards ceremonies, and features in many soundtracks in film and television.

It’s believed the track was inspired by German band Neu! whom Bowie was a fan of at the time. Neu! guitarist Michael Rother had been in conversation with Bowie a few times during Bowie’s time in Berlin and they had discussed the possibility of Rother playing on the album, but it didn’t happen due to a miscommunication.","September 23, 1977"

82Embed","“★” (pronounced “Blackstar”) is perhaps Bowie’s most experimental work since 1977’s Low. It contains several total shifts in instrumentation, but whilst images of death crop up repeatedly, the lyrics are abstruse and there are no obvious clues to any story unifying the fragments.

It is the titular first single from Bowie’s 27th  and final studio album, released on the 8th of January 2016. Bowie tragically died only two days later.  Unbeknownst to the world, he had been struggling with liver cancer for 18 months.

The song was originally conceived when Johan Renck asked Bowie to compose the theme music for The Last Panthers, a crime show he was directing. An edited version of the song was released for that purpose, before the single version was officially released in full on the 20th of November 2015. It was accompanied by a music video, full of bizarre imagery, directed by Renck.","November 8, 2015"

To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy

Now the workers have struck for fame

Is there life on Mars?105Embed","“Life on Mars?” is often considered one of the true masterpieces of the Bowie Canon. Originally released on the Hunky Dory album in 1971, it was made a single in 1973 during the height of Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust era.

The song details the story of a young girl who wants to go the movies, while her parents are not completely behind the idea. She goes anyway to find entertainment and escape. Instead, she finds out that the movie is a saddening bore as a poor parody of the mundane reality of her existence.

The situation prompts Bowie to raise the question, whether there is any life/art beyond what we already see.  It also raises the more existential questions about whether escapism through art is possible, when art is really a representation of reality (however popular or obscure).

A bit about how it was written:  In 1968, Bowie wrote the lyrics “Even a Fool Learns to Love”, set to the music of a 1967 French song “Comme d'habitude”, composed by Claude François and Jacques Revaux. Bowie’s version was never released, but Paul Anka bought the rights to the original French version and rewrote it into “My Way”, the song made famous by Frank Sinatra in a 1969 recording on his album of the same name. The success of the Anka version prompted Bowie to write “Life on Mars?” as a parody of Sinatra’s recording.

In an article that accompanied the June 2008 issue of The Mail on Sunday’s free cover-mount CD, iSELECTBOWIE, Bowie described the creation of the song:


This song was so easy. Being young was easy. A really beautiful day in the park, sitting on the steps of the bandstand. ‘Sailors bap-bap-bap-bap-baaa-bap’. An anomic (not a ‘gnomic’) heroine. Middle class ecstasy. I took a walk to Beckenham High Street to catch a bus to Lewisham to buy shoes and shirts but couldn’t get the riff out of my head. Jumped off two stops into the ride and more or less loped back to the house up on Southend Road.

Workspace was a big empty room with a chaise lounge; a bargain priced art nouveau screen (‘William Morris’ so I told anyone who asked); a huge overflowing freestanding ashtray and a grand piano. Little else. I started working it out on the piano and had the whole lyric and melody finished by late afternoon. Nice. Rick Wakeman came over a couple of weeks later and embellished the piano part and guitarist Mick Ronson created one of his first and best string parts for this song which now has become something of a fixture in my live shows.
- as quoted on davidbowie.com


Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph ranked it as #1 in his 100 Greatest Songs of All Time list, saying about the song…

A quite gloriously strange anthem, where the combination of stirring, yearning melody and vivid, poetic imagery manage a trick very particular to the art of the song: to be at once completely impenetrable and yet resonant with personal meaning. You want to raise your voice and sing along, yet Bowie’s abstract cut-up lyrics force you to invest the song with something of yourself just to make sense of the experience. And, like all great songs, it’s got a lovely tune.

Pitchfork also rated it as the best song of the 1970s.

The music video was shot by long time Bowie photographer, Mick Rock backstage at Earls Court to go along with the single release.

A slightly different version of the song was remastered in 2016 and included in the compilation The Legacy as the “2016 Mix”. An HD remastered alternate cut of the video was used to promote it.","June 17, 1971"

Look up here, I'm in heaven
I've got scars that can't be seen
I've got drama, can't be stolen
Everybody knows me now

Look up here, man, I'm in danger
I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so high, it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below
Ain't that just like me?

By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
There I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass

This way or no way
You know I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Now, ain't that just like me?
Oh, I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Oh, I'll be free
Ain't that just like me?
52Embed","Originally written for an eponymous off-Broadway production revisiting the character Thomas Gerome Newton 30 years after The Man Who Fell To Earth, the film adaptation of which Bowie starred in, Bowie’s “Lazarus” addresses themes of mortality. The video  and its accompanying album were released on Bowie’s birthday (8th January), just days before his untimely death from liver cancer. It is a supremely artistic, supremely Bowie statement: a condensation of the human narrative, birth, death, into a single song and, like the Biblical parable of Lazarus (see bottom of this annotation) death pervades in life, as life pervades in death.

The video contains several tellingly morbid images – a hospital bed, a suspiciously coffin-like wardrobe, Bowie appearing frail, his eyes obscured in Oedipal anguish, as the camera shakes, careers in one long take. Critics have read it as a goodbye, noting its new-found poignance.

Musically, like its parent album, it utilises a mixture of Rock and Jazz instrumentation, with the synths that have been a tenet of Bowie’s oeuvre since his Berlin period. It is sombre, yet still experimental and flighty. Bowie’s voice often cracks, weak and raspy, as the distorted guitars and the saxophone of Danny McCaslin create a decidedly melancholy sonic landscape, elegiac in atmosphere.

The cast of Lazarus played the piece on 15/12/15,  for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.



Lazarus of Bethany was resurrected by Jesus Christ, after 4 days of being dead, though years of cultural appropriation, allusion and moulding of the Lazarus narrative have turned Lazarus into more than a person, but an image, a cultural meme, reflecting life, death and resurrection; eternal return. Above is Bloch’s interpretation of the story, The Raising of Lazarus.","December 15, 2015"

But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes

And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

You've left us up to our necks in it

Ah, changes are taking the pace I'm going through

I really can't stay (But, baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say, ""No, no, no, sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

I really can't stay
(Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside

I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay
(Get over that cold out)

In the late 2010s, the track has faced backlash over its forceful nature towards the female protagonist, largely instigated by an American radio station banning the song in support of the #MeToo movement.","August 6, 1959"

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low

How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing

Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

It’s been covered in many languages, and this Dean Martin cover was (and still is) very popular in the U.S.  The song first appeared in the U.S. on his 1958 album This Is Dean Martin.

In the song, the protagonist describes the feeling of flying he has when he’s with his lover.

The original song (and some covers) of the song open with a surreal prelude:

Penso che un sogno così non ritorni mai più. Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu; poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito, e incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito.""

English translation:

“I think that a dream like that will never return. I painted my hands and my face blue, then was suddenly swept up by the wind and started to fly in the infinite sky.”

Stay with me, sway with me

I'd arrange for every girl to have your charms

Everybody loves somebody sometime2Embed","This song was first written in 1947 by Sam Coslow, Irving Taylor and pianist Ken Lane. Martin had first sung a version of this song in 1948 on Bob Hope’s radio show.
Ken Lane, who was recording with Dean Martin on his Dream with Dean LP sessions, recommended that Martin give the song a try, despite the fact that by 1964 the song had been released by various artists, including Frank Sinatra without a major success. Martin re-recorded the song for his next album, this time with a full orchestra and chorus. His label, Reprise Records, was so enthusiastic about the hit potential of this version they even titled the LP Everybody Loves Somebody to capitalize on it.

Although he was a major recording artist, prior to the release of this song, Dean Martin had not had a Top 40 hit since 1958. With the British Invasion ruling the U.S. charts at the time, his producers and his record company did not hold high hopes that an Italian crooner who had been singing mainly standards for almost 20 years would sway many teenagers. Martin resented rock n' roll, and his attitude created conflict at home with his 14-year-old son Dean Paul Martin, who liked groups such as The Beatles. He told his son, “I’m gonna' knock your pallies off the charts,” and in August 15, 1964 he did just that: “Everybody Loves Somebody” knocked the Beatles “A Hard Day’s Night” off the number one slot on Billboard, going straight up to the top of both the Billboard Hot 100 and the “Pop-Standard Singles” chart, the latter for eight weeks.

The song eventually replaced “That’s Amore” as Martin’s signature song, and he sang it as the theme of his weekly television variety show from 1965 until 1974. The song has become so identified with Martin that later versions are invariably compared to his take.

The song was so immensely popular that the words “Everybody Loves Somebody” appear on Dean Martin’s grave marker in Los Angeles.

Last night I dreamed
That you were here with me
And we were in each others arms, it was oh so heavenly
You held me close to you and whispered in my ear
""Let's build a life together, share love beyond compare""

As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share (Then the music stopped)
In a flash I was all alone (It was just a dream)
Haunting me once again

A dream, a simple fantasy
That I, wished was reality
That you'd, come knocking at my door
And we'd, relive this dream once more

The day you left, you said you would return
Just when you wouldn't promise, said you needed time alone
You said you loved me and someday our love could be
I couldn't understand it, I thought we were both happy

As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share (Then the music stopped)
In a flash I was all alone (It was just a dream)
Haunting me once again
A dream, a simple fantasy
(A simple fantasy that I)
That I, wished was reality (Oh, oh, that you, ooh)
That you'd, come knocking at my door
(And we'd) And we'd, relive this dream once more

Hold me, love me, with all your heart
Oh, oh, come back
Please make my dream come true for me
I need so much for you to see
I need you to love me once again

That I, wished was reality

As one of the only DeBarge songs where Bunny takes lead vocals, it’s presumably from a woman’s point of view. Further, it’s one of the more tragic songs in the DeBarge catalogue as the narrator’s hope of reuniting with a former partner is granted each night in a recurring dream. However, each morning she’s jolted into reality only to once again realize that she’s alone in the world and has no one to love or love her. The tragedy is that she may be able to move on to another relationship, but each night the dream retards her progress.","September 24, 1983"

Deep Purple,Smoke on the Water,"Smoke on the Water Lyrics

We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what, we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

Deep Purple,Soldier of Fortune,"Soldier of Fortune Lyrics
I have often told you stories
About the way
I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand
And sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
Come lay with me and love me
And I would surely stay

But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going around
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

Many times I've been a traveler
I looked for something new
In days of old
When nights were cold
I wandered without you
But those days I thought my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here
Now I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going around
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

Of a windmill going around

“Child In Time” is an anti-Vietnam War protest song considered the band’s epic achievement as well as one of the greatest progressive rock pieces of all time.

Each member’s musical strengths created a composition that so powerfully captured the moods and chaos of the times highlighted by Jon Lord’s haunting organ, Ritchie Blackmore’s bluesy machine gun-like guitar solos and Ian Gillan’s vocal in what is perhaps the finest performance in the history of the heavy metal/hard rock genre.

Gillan has admitted “Child In Time” is based on  American band It’s A Beautiful Day’s 1969 psychedelic rock piece Bombay Calling. Though faster paced and violin driven, Deep Purple borrowed a substantial part of the arrangement as the basis for Lord and Blackmore’s instrumental riffs and solos. In 1970 It’s A Beautiful Day lifted Deep Purple’s “Wring That Neck” and morphed it into “Don And Dewey” from their second album Marrying Maiden.

Deep Purple in Rock marked a return to their rock roots after flirting with classical music influences in some of their previous work.



A very apt album cover, Deep Purple In Rock is considered a cornerstone with Black Sabbath’s first two albums in 1970, as the foundation of what became heavy metal (here).","June 3, 1970"

It was released as the lead single and, despite not charting, it is still considered one of their most popular songs.

This song was born on a tour bus going to Portsmouth in 1971 when a reporter asked the band how they wrote songs. To demonstrate, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore grabbed an acoustic guitar and began playing a riff consisting of a single “G” repeated over and over, while vocalist Ian Gillan improvised lyrics over the top. The song was refined and was performed that same night.","March 25, 1972"

Past midnight I still see the land

We were fools, we called her a liar

""Burn!""

I didn't believe she was the devil's sperm
She said, ""Curse you all, you'll never learn""
""When I leave there's no return""
The people laughed till she said, ""Burn!""

Earth was shaking, we stood and stared
When it came no one was spared
Still I hear

It’s considered one of the best album openers for any Deep Purple album alongside Highway Star. It was and still is never performed live when the previous singer Ian Gillan came back to the band in 1984, and again in 1992.

Later, in 2015, David Coverdale (with his newer band Whitesnake) recorded a cover of this song for their album of Deep Purple covers called The Purple Album. He also frequently performed covers of this song (and others from his time with them) live with Whitesnake over the years. Ritchie Blackmore’s other band Rainbow has also performed the song live on various concerts. Glenn Hughes re-recorded it as a US and Japan bonus song on his 1994 solo album From Now On….","February 15, 1974"

The first is that Joe Elliot asked Mutt Lange if he wanted one lump or two in his tea, to which Lange responded, “I don’t care, just pour some sugar on me.” The other is producer Mutt Lange overheard Elliot “playing around on the acoustic guitar singing ‘pour some sugar on me'”, and he insisted the song be fleshed out. Elliot believes that the first record he ever bought, ""Sugar Sugar” by The Archies, was probably his subliminal inspiration for this track, as that song contains the very similar lyric “pour a little sugar on it, baby”.

Elliot was also inspired by the recent success of Run DMC’s groundbreaking collaboration with Aerosmith on “Walk This Way”. Elliot explained in 2000:

All of the sudden, rock and rap did mix, so we wrote our own.

Because Hysteria was already so far behind schedule and cost so much at that point, the record company originally did not want the band to spend more time and money finishing it to include it on the record, but Lange convinced them to allow it.

Released as the second UK single for the album, it reached a very respectable #18 there. It had similar success in Australia and New Zealand.

In the US, it was Hysteria’s fourth single – released a full seven months after the album had come out. At first it was “a complete failure” with rock stations, and the song “was close to being shelved”. However, when producer Mutt Lange remixed it for pop stations, 70 of them picked the song up and “it exploded” across the nation, rocketing to #2 on the pop chart and finally driving the eleven-month-old Hysteria to the top of the albums chart in July of 1988.","September 8, 1987"

In the US, where the lead single there, “Women”, had stalled at #80, “Animal” followed it up and did much better – becoming the first of five songs in a row to breach the top 20, beginning the album’s steady climb to #1 in the summer of ‘88 and being the launchpad to propel the album to 10x platinum (aka diamond) within three years.",September 1987

The album came out in the fall of 1987 and this single peaked at #12 in April 1989 – a year and a half later! It was the sixth straight top 20 hit for the band from the album in both the UK  and the US. It also reached the top 20 in Australia and New Zealand.

Originally conceived as mostly instrumental song (with the only lyrics being the titular “rocket” and ‘yeah!’), “Rocket” evolved in the studio to have full choruses and verses – written in tribute to the rock artists of the 60s and 70s the band listened to in their youth. Def Leppard later released an entire album based on this era.",January 1988

Demi Lovato,Sober,"Sober Lyrics
I got no excuses for all of these goodbyes
Call me when it's over 'cause I'm dying inside
Wake me when the shakes are gone
And the cold sweats disappear
Call me when it's over and myself has reappeared

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I do it every, every, every time
It's only when I'm lonely
Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight
I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
Just hold me, I'm lonely

Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore
And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor
To the ones who never left me, we've been down this road before
I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore

I'm sorry to my future love for the man that left my bed
For making love the way I saved for you inside my head
And I'm sorry for the fans I lost who watched me fall again
I wanna be a role model, but I'm only human
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I do it every, every, every time
It's only when I'm lonely
Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight
I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
Just hold me, I'm lonely

And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor
To the ones who never left me, we've been down this road before

The song provides an open confession about facing recent challenges regarding her six-year sobriety. They made their achievement public on Twitter in March 2018:

However, the lyrics indicate how they may have possibly relapsed; their prior battle with addiction included the use of prescription drugs, cocaine, and alcohol.

Their 2017 documentary, Simply Complicated, depicts their mixed struggle with addiction, bipolar disorder, and childhood experiences which have shaped their life and influenced their journey through fame and fortune.

Stone cold, stone cold
You see me standing, but I'm dying on the floor
Stone cold, stone cold
Maybe if I don't cry, I won't feel anymore

Stone cold, baby
God knows I try to feel happy for you
Know that I am, even if I can't understand
I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart, we'll make it through
If happy is her, I'm happy for you

Hmmm, stone cold, stone cold
You're dancing with her, while I'm staring at my phone
Stone cold, stone cold
I was your amber, but now she's your shade of gold

Stone cold, baby
God knows I try to feel happy for you
Know that I am, even if I can't understand
I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart, we'll make it through
If happy is her, I'm happy for you
Don't wanna be stone cold, stone

If nobody's listening

In the vulnerable ballad, Demi can be heard crying for help as they talk about wanting someone to be there through the tough times with them.

Speaking to Zane Lowe in an interview on Apple Music’s New Music Daily, Demi recalled that no one had helped them with their struggles back when they wrote and recorded the song days before her drug overdose back in July of 2018:


I almost listen back and hear these lyrics as a cry for help. [And] you kind of think, “How did nobody listen to this song and think, ‘Let’s help this girl’.”

[Back then,] I was recording [the song] in a state of mind where I felt like I was OK — but clearly I wasn’t. I even listen back to it and I’m like, “Gosh, I wish I could go back in time to help that version of myself.”


Lovato’s GRAMMY performance of the track was first teased back in December 4, 2019, via Instagram with the caption, “The next time you hear from me, I’ll be singing….” Weeks later, on January 14, 2020, their performance of the then-unnamed song was announced.

According to the ‘music insider’ who had correctly confirmed Lovato’s GRAMMY performance, the song will not serve as the lead single from their upcoming seventh studio album. This was previously pointed out by fans after discovering that the song has not been officially sent to radio.","January 26, 2020"
Demi Lovato,Let It Go,"Let It Go Lyrics
Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
Couldn’t keep it in, Heaven knows I tried

Don’t let them in, don’t let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know
Well, now they know

Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway
It’s funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can’t get to me at all
Up here in the cold thin air
I finally can breathe
I know I left a life behind
But I’m too relieved to grieve

Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

Standing frozen in the life I’ve chosen
You won't find me, the past is so behind me
Buried in the snow

Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

The pop version plays over the closing credit sequence, with Demi Lovato singing, whereas the film version is sung by Wicked’s Idina Menzel.

The choice of Lovato to record the single version was inspired by Demi’s own life journey, Kristen Anderson-Lopez shared:

It just so happened that Demi was part of the Disney family already, and that [they] had a past that [they’re] pretty open about that is similar to Elsa’s journey of letting a dark past and fear behind and moving forward with your power.","November 27, 2013"

Mmm, ooh, yeah
Mustard on the beat, ho

He felt just like you
His arms, his lips
His promises were just as smooth
His grip, it fit, though I admit that
Only you could make me feel the way you do
Though, you know love is blind
And he just caught my eye

You know me and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hoping and praying
My knees weak, I'm shaking
'Cause you know that I always needed saving

Now I'm fucking lonely 'cause you didn't want me
Trying to show me, that you didn't own me
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Knees on the concrete, cut up and bleeding
For no goddamn reason
But all you do is leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
The month was June
The smoky sun, our fated one
It ended too soon
With tears as proof, 'cause all the carpets stained with juice
Blood on my shoes and you know love is blind
I can see it in your eyes

You know me and honestly I'm better without ya
Don't you got me checking on my phone by the hour
Baby, I'm hoping and praying
My knees weak, I'm shaking
'Cause you know that I always needed saving

Now I'm fucking lonely 'cause you didn't want me
Trying to show me, that you didn't own me

Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Leave me fucking lonely
Bitch, can't even say I miss you back over the fuckin' text
Every time you slept over my pad, you over fuckin' slept
Toni Braxton told me breathe again, don't hold no fuckin' breath
Gave your ass directions to my heart and your ass busted left
Climbin' up the money tree, the tree without the lover's nest
'Cause lovebirds are some busy bees
You fuck around, get stung again
And you didn't leave your underwear
'Cause she didn't arrive in no underwear
Look, baby, either love is blind or nothing's there, because
I can't see the forest from the tree, the water from the sea
And I was starting to believe, but it's a forest full of dreams
I smoke bars full of weed and call it what I see
And when you leave, I hope you know you bring
This forest to his leaves
I'm fucking lonely, yeah

Layla was one of the tracks on their first and widely acclaimed album, Layla and Other Assorted Songs.



The song is about the woman he loves: Beatles guitarist George Harrison’s wife, Pattie Boyd.  Indeed, it’s one of the notorious ten songs written by three different singer-songwriters who were smitten with Pattie Boyd.
Harrison & Boyd later divorced and she and Clapton were married in 1979.

The song’s name is inspired by a 12th century Persian poem about a desperate, unreciprocated love: The Story of Layla

In 1992 Eric Clapton released an acoustic slowed down version which became a huge success and won him a Grammy Award.

Derek and the Dominos,Bell Bottom Blues,"Bell Bottom Blues Lyrics

Bell bottom blues, you made me cry
I don't want to lose this feeling
And if I could choose a place to die
It would be in your arms

Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay

It's all wrong, but it's all right
The way that you treat me baby, mmh
Once I was strong but I lost the fight
You won't find a better loser

Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please

If you find me with another lover

Musically, “Israelites” is all about Jamacian syncopation. A guitar and organ provide opening chords and counterpoints, but it’s the Jamaican reggae rhythm expressed by that jittery drummer, combined with those terrific vocals that defines the song.

The song is rooted in the ideas of the Rastafarian religion, which borrows the idea of the twelve Tribes from Judaism: the “Israelites”. Rastafarians see Ethipoia as the home of the Falasha or Beta Israel; the home of the “Lost Tribes” of Israel, and they see themselves as their descendants. This loosely organized religion became popular in the 1960s among poor Jamaicans.",October 1968

“007 (Shanty Town)” was a number one song in Jamaica and reached number twelve in the U.K. charts in July 1967 prompting a tour of England to support the song.  The song also appeared in the highly influential soundtrack to Jimmy Cliff’s The Harder They Come and is an influence for The Clash’s “Rudie Can’t Fail.”



In Dekker’s own words:  I write this song because of what was happening at the time.  The students had a demonstration and it went all the way around to Four Shore Road and down to Shanty Town.  You got wild life and hting like that because it down near to the beach and the higher ones wanted to bulldoze the whole thing down and do their own thing and the students said no way.  And it just get out of control.  And whasoever you hear on the records, that is what was going down.  Man take a stone and throw it through the window, lick after somebody, and you read it as somebody just knock it and gone.  Is just a typical riot ‘cause I say – Them a loot, them a shoot, them a wail.
  It was wild, wild. … “Shanty Town” was the one that gave me international recognition.

It also peaked at #5  on the Billboard Hot 100 and #6 on Billboard’s R&B chart. “I’m Coming Out” also performed well overseas.

Diana Ross,Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,"Ain’t No Mountain High Enough Lyrics
If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
On that you can depend and never worry
You see, my love is alive
It's like a seed that only needs the thought of you to grow
So if you feel the need for company
Please, my darling, let it be me

I may not be able to express
The depth of the love I feel for you
But a writer put it very nicely
When he was away from the one he loved
He sat down and wrote these words

No wind, (no wind) no rain, (no rain)
Nor winter's cold
Can stop me, babe (oh, babe) baby (baby)
If you're my goal
No wind, no rain
Can stop
If you want to go
I know, I know you must follow the sun
Wherever it leads
But remember
If you should fall short of your desires
Remember life holds for you one guarantee
You'll always have me
And if you should miss my love
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms
That used to hold you so close, or the lips
That used to touch yours so tenderly
Just remember what I told you
The day I set you free

Ain't no mountain high enough, aah
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (say it again)
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (one more time)
Ain't no river wide enough (say it again)
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
To keep me from you

It was originally sung by Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell which became a hit in 1967.

In the song, Diana is receiving mixed signals from her partner, and she has finally given up on the relationship. It is her partner’s turn to show that he really cares about Diana, but he is running out of time to prove so.

The song was brought into modern light after vaporwave producer MACINTOSH PLUS heavily sampled the track for a song titled ‘リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュ’ (“Lisa Frank 420 / Modern Computing”) on their 2011 album FLORAL SHOPPE. Their remix of the track is possibly the most famous song in the Vaporwave genre.","September 13, 1984"

You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out of feeling nothing

You set your mark on stealing my heart away
Crying, trying, anything for you

I wanna get you where I can let you make all that love to me

To anywhere and there ain't no salvation

So you can set me free

We talk about love

You taste a little then you swallow slower

The Supremes,You Can’t Hurry Love,"You Can’t Hurry Love Lyrics
I need love, love
To ease my mind
I need to find, find
Someone to call mine
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love
To let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Yeah, it's almost gone
I remember mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break?

No I can't bear
To live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love
To call my own
But when I feel that I
I can't go on
These precious words keeps me hangin' on
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
(Now wait)
No, love, love
Don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
I keep on waiting (Ooh, until that day)
But it ain't easy
It ain't easy
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
(repeat and fade)3Embed","“You Can’t Hurry Love” is a song performed by American female vocal group and Motown Records' most commercially successful act The Supremes. Written and produced by one of Motown’s more accomplished songwriting teams Holland-Dozier-Holland (Brian & Eddie Holland and Lamont Dozier), the song features the silky smooth vocals of Diana Ross on lead and Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson on background vocals, as well as Motown’s session band, The Funk Brothers, helping out on all of the instrumentation. The song was recorded on June 11th and July 5th, 1966, in Hitsville U.S.A. (Studio A). It was released soon after on July 25th, 1966, as the second single from their ninth studio album “The Supremes A' Go-Go” on Motown Records on August 25th that same year, following their first single “Love is Like an Itching in My Heart.” The single was also the A-side to “Put Yourself in My Place,” a track that was actually recorded by four different Motown artists and groups, including The Supremes.

“You Can’t Hurry Love” was released in the middle of the group’s transition from the sounds of their earlier teenage, bubblegum pop phase – which is understandable considering all of their previously released music was recorded when they were in their late teens and early 20s – to more mature themes and musical arrangements.  With this development of their sound came the peak of the group’s success, topping the charts both in the United States and internationally. “You Can’t Hurry Love” was The Supremes' seventh number-one hit single on the Billboard Hot 100, claiming the top spot for two weeks in September 1966. The single also reached number one on the soul chart for two weeks, number one on the U.S. Cash Box Pop Singles chart, peaked at number three on both the Canadian RPM Singles and the U.K. Singles charts, and reached number six on the Australian Singles chart, to name a few. The single also peaked at number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and the U.K. Singles year-end charts. Additionally, the song was permanently inducted into the list of “500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll,” sponsored by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The song was later covered by a number of artists, including the Dixie Chicks on the soundtrack to the 1999 film “Runaway Bride.” However, the most notable cover of “You Can’t Hurry Love” was performed by English vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Phil Collins in November 1982 on his second studio album, “Hello, I Must Be Going!”. Collins' version topped the U.K. Singles charts – a feat not previously achieved by The Supremes and Collins’s first number-one hit in his home country – and peaked at number ten in the U.S. Collins explains that his version of the song was not meant to serve as an interpretation of the original Supremes tune but, rather, as a remake. Many of his musical influences came out of Motown, so his cover was meant to serve as a thankful tribute  to the record company who later influenced his musical stylings. Lamont Dozier, one of the song’s original writers, later commented on Collins’s cover, saying that it was respectful to Motown to keep so many of the original aspects of the song and that his cover was very well done.","August 25, 1966"

According to Rolling Stone, Motown label owner Berry Gordy at first thought the song “wasn’t catchy enough”, and sent the group back to the studio, resulting in the catchy “Oooh” at the beginning.

It was their second song that topped the charts, making them the first Motown group that had two #1 songs.

In 2021, the song placed #499 in Rolling Stone’s “500 Best Songs of All Time”.","September 17, 1964"

It was written by Lamont Dozier and brothers Brian and Eddie Holland—Motown’s premiere songwriting team. This song marked something of a new start for Holland-Dozier-Holland, as they wanted to try weightier subject matter.
According to Dozier, the song’s one-note guitar part was inspired by Morse Code-style radio news flashes.

Holland-Dozier-Holland got out of Motown’s life in 1967—this was the last of their Supremes hits before leaving the label.

Generations of fans have hung on to this song—it’s returned to the charts on three different occasions. In 1967, psychedelic rockers Vanilla Fudge reached #6 on the Hot 100 with their version.

In 1986, British singer Kim Wilde took the song to back to #1. Wilde’s success made “You Keep Me Hangin’ On” one of the only hits to top the charts by two different artists.

In 1996, country singer Reba McEntire dropped a version that climbed to #2 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.","October 26, 1966"

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah)
You think that I don't feel love
But what I feel for you is real love
In those eyes, I see reflected
A hurt, scorned, rejected

Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me
Started my life in an old, cold, rundown
Tenement slum (Tenement slum)
My father left, he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name
Ah, this love we're contemplating
Is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating
The child we may be creating
Love child, never meant to be (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Love child (Scorned by) society
Love child, always second best (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Love child, different from the rest
(Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby
(Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby
I started school in a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out (Somebody threw out)
I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me
Ah, don't think that I don't need you
Don't think I don't wanna please you
But no child of mine will be bearing
The name of shame I've been wearing

Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood (Just a little bit longer, love child)

I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)

After Holland-Dozier-Holland left Motown in 1968 in a dispute over royalties, label founder Berry Gordy scrambled to assemble a team that could write another hit for the Supremes.

To make a hit, Gordy brought together British songwriter Pam Sawyer, guitarist Deke Richards, R. Dean Taylor, and Frank Wilson—he dubbed them “the Clan.”

Diana Ross sang lead vocals on “Love Child,” while backing vocals were done by Motown session singers the Andantes. The Supremes’ Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong, both in the group at the time, do not sing on the record.

They claimed Berry Gordy was trying to  maintain power over the girls by making them feel expendable. When the Supremes performed “Love Child” on the Ed Sullivan Show, they wore drab sweatpants and stood barefoot to match the subject matter of the song.","September 30, 1968"

Motown Records brought in Bristol to produce a new version of the song for Jr. Walker & the All-Stars, but Motown chief Berry Gordy decided to give it to Diana Ross as her first solo single away from The Supremes. Bristol struggled to get the sound he wanted from Ross, and encouraged her along the way, which made it onto tape: That’s him coaching Diana through the song, offering “Sing it pretty” and “You better” along the way. Also Motown decided to release this as by “Diana Ross and the Supremes,” even though Ross was the only member of the group whose voice is on the recording.","October 14, 1969"

Dierks Bentley,Drunk on a Plane,"Drunk on a Plane Lyrics
I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane25Embed","Co-written by Dierks Bentley, Chris Tompkins, and Josh Kear and released on April 21, 2014, as the third single from Bentley’s 2014 album, Riser.

If it wasn't known, that our love will carry on
I will be the wind that echo's on the canyon wall
One more day with you, to walk around our neighbourhood
We will never know like it was understood

We never say goodbye
Just let me hold the light

If you've given up, I will call an end to this
I will be your rock from our perch
If you walk the ridge, you will find the marks, the scars
Kneel down by the tree, under the city stone

We never say goodbye
Just let me hold the light
We never say goodbye
I'll see you on this side
Or the other way
The desert sun kisses the sky
Baby hold the light
And keep it in your eyes
And promise that you dream with me
Beyond the walls of time
And when we laid aside
Just look up at the light
Just let me hold the light
Just let me hold the light1Embed","On June 30th, 2013, 19 firefighters from the Granite Mountain Hotshots were killed by a wildfire near Yarnell, Arizona.

And some days I ain't even close

This mornin' I got up at 6:01
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree I've seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my t-shirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind
I said ""Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough""
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest

When speaking to The Boot, Dierks said this about the song:

It was something I was thinking about for a long time, but I was cautious about wading into it, because I knew I wanted to write this song – the idea is about my wife. A lot of songs, you start with a good idea and it doesn’t work out, and you move on to the next thing. Or you tweak the title and try to write it with somebody else. But with “Black,” there’s only one “Black.” I can’t write “Blue;” that’s already been written.

One important thing to note about the title of this song (and album) is that Dierks wife’s maiden name was “Black.”","May 14, 2016"

A smooth lightheartedness takes center stage, and (as Nadine Cohodas notes in Queen) “showed that the voice that gave life to the words could be as important as—perhaps more important than—the words themselves.”

Contrasted to her other fabulous version, Dinah in this one molds the lyrics to her own groove, especially with the substitution of the “shooting star” for an astronaut zooming by. But it is the change of tone in that moment—the dipping into a voice still more intimate, playful, alluring, whimsical and putting the speaker on an equal level of proactivity with the beloved “teacher”—that displays the power of her personality in addition to (or at the heart of) that of her lungs as when she finishes the track.

Take such strength and concentration in concordance with those seemingly effortless individual touches, and one need not be told that Aretha Franklin, who would cover the song, “worshiped Dinah Washington.”",1954

James Horner first wrote the musical backing  as part of the score, taking inspiration from Jethro Tull. Then he decided to add lyrics, courtesy of Will Jennings. After Celine Dion was convinced to record (not her first time doing a movie theme), Horner had to find a day where the notoriously ill-tempered Cameron would be welcoming to show him.

“My Heart Will Go On” then was turned into the end credits theme, and its association with the eventual highest-grossing movie ever (until Cameron topped his own record 11 years later) led to the song topping charts everywhere, as well as an Oscar and two Grammys… and overexposure to the point Titanic star Kate Winslet admits she feels like throwing up when hearing it.

FUN FACT: Celine did not want to record this song, check out her recent interview Andy Cohen. She elaborates on the song process as well.

How does a moment last forever?
How can a story never die?
It is love we must hold onto
Never easy, but we try
Sometimes our happiness is captured
Somehow, our time and place stand still
Love lives on inside our hearts and always will

Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on

Maybe some moments weren’t so perfect
Maybe some memories not so sweet
But we have to know some bad times
Or our lives are incomplete
Then when the shadows overtake us
Just when we feel all hope is gone
We’ll hear our song and know once more
Our love lives on

How does a moment last forever?
How does our happiness endure?
Through the darkest of our troubles
Love is beauty, love is pure
Love pays no mind to desolation
It flows like a river through the soul
Protects, proceeds, and perseveres
And makes us whole
Minutes turn to hours, days to years then gone
But when all else has been forgotten
Still our song lives on

You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (When I couldn't speak)
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (My voice)

Céline Dion,Pour que tu m’aimes encore,"Pour que tu m’aimes encore Lyrics
J'ai compris tous les mots
J'ai bien compris, merci
Raisonnable et nouveau
C'est ainsi par ici
Que les choses ont changé
Que les fleurs ont fané
Que le temps d'avant
C'était le temps d'avant
Que si tout zappe et lasse
Les amours aussi passent

Il faut que tu saches

J'irai chercher ton cœur
Si tu l'emportes ailleurs
Même si dans tes danses
D'autres dansent tes heures
J'irai chercher ton âme
Dans les froids dans les flammes
Je te jetterai des sorts
Pour que tu m'aimes encore
Pour que tu m'aimes encore
Fallait pas commencer
M'attirer me toucher
Fallait pas tant donner
Moi je sais pas jouer
On me dit qu'aujourd'hui
On me dit que les autres font ainsi
Je ne suis pas les autres
Avant que l'on s'attache
Avant que l'on se gache

Je veux que tu saches

J'irai chercher ton cœur
Si tu l'emportes ailleurs
Même si dans tes danses
D'autres dansent tes heures
J'irai chercher ton ame
Dans les froids dans les flammes
Je te jetterai des sorts
Pour que tu m'aimes encore

Je trouverai des langages
Pour chanter tes louanges
Je ferai nos bagages
Pour d'infinies vendanges
Les formules magiques
Des marabouts d'Afrique
J'les dirai sans remords
Pour que tu m'aimes encore
Je m'inventerai reine
Pour que tu me retiennes
Je me ferai nouvelle
Pour que le feu reprenne
Je deviendrai ces autres
Qui te donnent du plaisir
Vos jeux seront les nôtres
Si tel est ton désir
Plus brillante plus belle
Pour une autre étincelle
Je me changerai en or
Pour que tu m'aimes encore

Pour que tu m'aimes encore
Pour que tu m'aimes encore
Pour que tu m'aimes encore
Pour que tu m'aimes encore
Tu m'aimes, tu m'aimes
Tu m'aimes encore


I understood all the words, I well understood, thanks
Reasonable and new, that's the way here
Things have changed, that flowers get fade
That the time before, was the time before
If all zap and tire, loves also go by
You must know

I'll go get your heart if you take it somewhere else
Even if in your dances others dance your hours
I'll go get your soul in the colds in the flammes
I'll cast a spell on you for you to still love me

Shouldn't begin tease me touch me
Shouldn't give so much I don't know how to play
They say that today, they say others do so
I'm not the others
Before we attach to the other, before we spoil each other
Je veux que tu saches
I want you to know

I'll go get your heart if you take it somewhere else
Even if in your dances others dance your hours
I'll go get your soul in the colds in the flammes
I'll cast a spell on you for you to still love me

I'll find languages to sing your praises
I'll make my luggage’s for infinite vintages
Magic spells from African priests
I'll say them without remorse for you to still love me

I'll name myself queen for you to hold me
I'll make myself new to let the fire restart
I'll become these others who give you pleasure
Your games will be ours if that's your wish
More brilliant more beautiful for another spark
I'll change myself into gold for you to still love me9Embed",?,"March 27, 1995"
Céline Dion,It’s All Coming Back to Me Now,"It’s All Coming Back to Me Now Lyrics
There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby, baby
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, baby, baby

When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now

(It's all coming back to me now)
And when you kiss me like this

Céline Dion,The Power of Love,"The Power of Love Lyrics
The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes
I hold on to your whole body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you
Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side
'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened, but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been

The song features an introduction with Sting singing “I want my MTV”. Because of this, this was the first song played on MTV Europe when it began airing. Sting received a songwriting credit for the intro, and consequently this is one of only three Dire Straits songs not credited to Knopfler alone.

The music video for the song was one of the first examples of CGI human characters. It won Video of the Year at the 1986 MTV Video Awards, one of the few prizes it managed to take from a-ha’s “Take on Me”, by the same director.","June 24, 1985"
Dire Straits,Sultans of Swing,"Sultans of Swing Lyrics
You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river
You stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie
Double-four time
You feel alright
When you hear the music ring

Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing
Yeah

And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole


And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it's time to go home""
Then he makes it fast
With one more thing
""We are the Sultans –
We are the Sultans of Swing""

You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that
Anyway, what ya gonna do about it?""

And I bet, when you exploded into my heart
And I forget, I forget

Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as I was just another one of your deals?

Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything
You promised me thick and thin, yeah
Now you just say, ""Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him""

And all I do is miss you, and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat and the bad company
And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time""

Released as a single in 1981, the track updates the classic Romeo and Juliet narrative, skipping over the death and destruction. It’s devastating nonetheless, as Knopfler catalogues the breakdown of a relationship brought about by bad timing. Thankfully, there’s redemption in the final passage.

A music video was filmed, and oddly, the track didn’t perform well commercially, although it was certified Gold in Italy.","October 17, 1980"
Dire Straits,Brothers in Arms,"Brothers in Arms Lyrics

These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms
23Embed","This song was released in 1985 as the closer to the album of the same name and is the third single from it, reaching #16 in the UK that October. It did not chart in the US.

The song is about the brotherly bonds forged by the destructive fire and pains of war. A bond between soldiers on both sides of the trenches. It focuses on the Falklands War, which was going on when Dire Straits lead singer Mark Knopfler wrote the song in 1982. The Falklands War was a conflict between Argentina and the United Kingdom over islands off the coast of Argentina that each country claims rights to. A new version of the song was released in 2007 by Knopfler in order to raise money to bring veterans of the war back to the Falklands as a way to treat their PTSD.

The video shows images of World War I, which corresponds with the theme of the song about war and brothers in arms.

The song is reported to be the first ever released as a CD single. It was released in the UK in 1985.","May 13, 1985"

Hey, sing about the sixblade, sing about the switchback
And a torture tattoo
And I've been riding on a ghost train
Where the cars they scream and slam
And I don't know where I'll be tonight
But I'd always tell you where I am
In a screaming ring of faces
I've seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races, yeah
Just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever
Said: ""Let it rock and let it roll""
I had the one arm bandit fever
There was an arrow through my heart and my soul

And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Yeah, love
It's just the danger, danger when you're riding at your own risk
She said: ""You are the perfect stranger""
She said: ""Baby, let's keep it like this""
It's just a cake walk, twisting baby, yeah, step right up and say:
""Hey Mister, give me two, give me two now, 'cos any two can play""

And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Oh, love, love

Well, it's been money for muscle on another whirligig
Money for muscle and another girl I dig
Another hustle just to, just to make it big
And rockaway, rockaway
Oh, rockaway, rockaway

And girl, it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Oh, like the Spanish City to me
When-a we were kids
Hey girl, it looks so pretty to me
Just like it always did
Oh, like the Spanish City to me
When-a we were kids
Check it out!


She took off a silver locket
She said: ""Remember me by this""
She put her hand in my pocket
I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of dust and diesel
I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough
But something must have made me stay

And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Yeah, love, love, love
On the tunnel of love
Oh, love, love

And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
In any shooting gallery where promises are made
To rockaway, rockaway
Rockaway, rockaway
From Cullercoats and Whitley Bay
Out to rockaway
And girl, it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me
When we were kids
Girl, it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me
When we were kids

A music video was filmed, with the images on the screen matching Mark’s lyrics. This helped it jump to number 54 in the UK Singles Charts. Knopfler pads the trad out with a warm solo that Rolling Stone praised at the time.

The reason for multiple writers is the intro instrumental, which is sampled from the musical Carousel.","October 17, 1980"
Dire Straits,Telegraph Road,"Telegraph Road Lyrics
A long time ago came a man on a track
Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back
And he put down his load
Where he thought it was the best
He made a home in the wilderness
He built a cabin and a winter store
And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore
And the other travelers came walking down the track
And they never went further, no
They never went back
Then came the churches, then came the schools
Then came the lawyers, and then came the rules
Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads
And the dirty old track was the telegraph road
Then came the mines, then came the ore
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside
Telegraph road got so deep and so wide
Like a rolling river

And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze
People driving home from the factories
There's six lanes of traffic
Three lanes moving slow

I used to like to go to work, but they shut it down
I've got a right to go to work
But there's no work here to be found
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed
We're gonna have to reap
From some seed that's been sowed
And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code
All the way down the telegraph road
You know, I'd sooner forget
But I remember those nights
When life was just a bet on a race
Between the lights
You had your head on my shoulder
You had your hand in my hair
Now you act a little colder
Like you don't seem to care
But believe in me, baby, and I'll take you away
From out of this darkness and into the day
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names
Cause I've run every red light on memory lane
I've seen desperation explode into flames
And I don't want to see it again
From all of these signs saying, ""sorry, but we're closed""
All the way
Down the telegraph road

It is a brilliant song with a thrilling riff from (4:08) to (4:17), and beautiful climaxes.



Telegraph Road, aka Highway 24, is a main road that runs north-south through suburban metro-Detroit. Mark Knopfler wrote the song while touring through Detroit, inspired by the book “Growth of the Soil” by Knut Hamsun. The song tells the chronological story of Telegraph Rd – from the time Henry Ford discovered the Michigan wilderness through the auto boom of the early twentieth century, through war, depression, and the collapse of industry again in the midwest.","September 20, 1982"

Showstopping, indelible and effusive—not to mention successful! It hit 11 in the UK and peaked at 7 in the US almost 2 years after its original release date. It also inspired Disclosure and Smith to collaborate again, with the two of them working together later on “Omen.”

British singer Sam Smith, who provides the vocals on the track, was initially hesitant to jump on the project. In an interview with KISS FM UK, they were quoted as saying:

I remember hearing “Latch” and I didn’t even know whether it was good or not, because I didn’t know electronic music or dance music. It just wasn’t for me.

Fortunately, despite their early inexperience, they took the opportunity and their career was launched.","October 4, 2012"

Never really felt bad about it
As we drank deep from the lie
'Cause I felt melting magnets, babe
The second I saw you through half-shut eyes

Smoke and sunset, off Mulholland
He was talking, I was wonderin' 'bout
You and that girl, she your girlfriend?
Face from heaven, bet the world she don't know
Pretty girls don't know the things that I know
Walk my way, I'll share the things that she won't

Uh-oh, dancing past the point of no return
Let go, we can free ourselves of all we've learned
I love this secret language that we're speakin'
Say it to me, let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return

Never really thought we would make it
We be thinking about what could have been
But we've had a record summer, can't turn it down, oh

Disclosure spoke about the collaboration in an interview with Pitchfork:

Well, we performed with her at the BRIT Awards and knew she was a really good singer. And she’s really nice as well, which is cool. When we had nearly finished the record, we got this call from her saying that she was in London and wanted to get in the studio, so we went in not really expecting anything. It was a quick process. That beat is more like a hip-hop beat than anything else, and we all liked it, so we just started writing—we didn’t have a board meeting at the start, like, “We’re gonna do this.”","September 23, 2015"

I'm feeling something, something different
When you left, my picture changed
I was blinded, I'd not envisioned
The same face in a different frame

It's an omen, caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me, without you I am lonely

My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

You left before  my eyes

This is the third collaboration between the artists, with the first being the huge international hit, “Latch”, and the second being “Together”.

This catchy pop tune about a love-story gone wrong was premiered on July 27th, 2015. The release also included a music video which continues on from “Holding On”. It depicts a night of dancing interrupted by police units. The short film ended with the ominous words “to be continued”.

In an interview with Pitchfork, the brothers said the following about this track:

We’re really close with Sam and we share the same managers, so it wasn’t too hard in terms of linking up the date. As a guy, he’s not changed at all—he’s the same Sam that we met four years ago. We’ve all just improved and have a lot more experience with writing with other people as well as on our own. In that sense, it was different.","July 27, 2015"

My hope is, descending like the sun
Try to tell myself there's freedom in the loneliness (Oh baby)
Always restless, story of my life
Disconnected, body clock's not right
Try to tell myself that I'mma get some sleep tonight

Found myself where I started, this isn't where I want to be
The time that I find hardest, always comes eventually

My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart

Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal

My demons are blocking out the light
And my mind is about to lose the fight
Why can't I find peace, when a caracal could sleep tonight? (Yeah)
Your absence isn't something that I choose (choose, choose choose)
But the truth is you were never mine to lose (lose, lose, lose)
Spending half my life just tryna get away from you (Oh baby, oh)

The Weeknd lends his R&B crooning to the track as he sings about insomnia and nighttime blues.

Guy Lawrence explains:

We’ve been fans of each other’s music for some time. We didn’t really know what he was like as a guy, but he turned out to be so safe and cool and chill—but not arrogant in any way. We wrote that song in Jungle Studios in New York, which is probably the coolest studio that we’ve ever been to. It has this panoramic view of Manhattan, so that informed the vibe.

In the EW interview Lawrence said:

The sun was going down and it was such a lovely vibe…and the vibe of driving around late and night, and it’s getting dark, and the beat’s pretty slow. Abel was loving it. We were all feeling that vibe and just let it flow. And it’s f—ing long, isn’t it? It’s like nothing we’ve made before.","September 25, 2015"

The assertive sample, which has the throb of a Southern minister in the throes of sweaty ministering, loads the song into a rigid, by-the-books house groove, and uses the abstract melodic features of its delivery to give that bobbing beat some mandatory bounce.

Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm going to show you what I'm made of
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone


Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
“Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the
Radio on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those
Wayfarers on, baby

It was a huge hit earning numerous awards including the Grammy for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance and the MTV Video of the Year.

The song explores the concepts of aging and questioning the past.  The subject in the song reminisces about past summer love and things that he has lost as time wears on.

The official video shows the progression of the main character at three distinct phases of his life:  young boy, teenager and middle-aged. Each   instance shows us how he is considering his past relationships, most likely regrettably.","October 29, 1984"

To air someone’s ‘dirty laundry’ means “discussing or arguing about unpleasant or private things in front of other people”. The song is about tabloid journalism, inspired by the intrusive press coverage surrounding the deaths of John Belushi and Natalie Wood, and Henley’s own arrest in 1980.

It peaked at #3 on the Billboard 100, reached the top 10 in Austria & New Zealand, and was a modest hit in the UK. It was his first of several top 40 US hits as a solo artist, and was certified Gold in March 1983.

Don Henley,New York Minute,"New York Minute Lyrics
Harry got up, dressed all in black
Went down to the station, and he never came back
They found his clothing scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning

He had a home, love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes as years unfurl
One day, he crossed some line, and he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, things can get pretty strange
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute

Lying here in the darkness, I hear the sirens wail
Somebody going to emergency, somebody's going to jail
You find somebody to love in this world, you better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door

In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, things can get a little strange
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute
And in these days, darkness falls early
And people rush home to the ones they love
You'd better take a fool's advice and take care of your own
One day they're here, next day they're gone

Pulled my coat around my shoulders, took a walk down through the park
Leaves were falling around me, groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock, a desperate lover left his mark
""Baby, I've changed, please come back""

What the head makes cloudy, the heart makes very clear
I know the days were so much brighter in the time when she was here
I know that somebody somewhere can make these dark clouds disappear
But until that day, I have to believe, I believe, I believe

In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, you can get out of the rain
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York, New York minute
In a New York minute, everything can change

Don Henley,The Heart of the Matter,"The Heart of the Matter Lyrics
I got the call today, I didn't wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone

And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me
And you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

But I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew
I'm learning again

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me anymore
These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
And people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive
In such a graceless age?

The trust and self-assurance
That lead to happiness
They're the very things
We kill, I guess
Oh, pride and competition
Cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
You know it doesn't keep me warm

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I figured out
I have to learn again

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me anymore
There are people in your life
Who've come and gone
They let you down
You know they hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you, baby
Cause life goes on
You keep carrying that anger
It'll eat you up inside, baby

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter

And rolled beneath a deep blue sky

And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details

And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense

They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king

And wash away this sin

Now we've come so far, so fast
But, somewhere back there in the dust

So baby give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye
Just lay your head back on the ground

The song is about the end of the innocence of the baby boomer generation.



The song is one of the most-remembered Henley tunes from his post-Eagles solo phase, and it was aimed at his own generation of boomers. The wealth and status obsessed 1980s were closing, and boomers collectively felt a certain uneasiness about the future (and a little guilt about their heyday).

The lyrics clearly speak to that without preaching.  In an interview with the London Free Press, Henley said this about social commentary in music:

“I think there’s always a place for a little social commentary — after all, that is one of the basic principles of rock, folk, blues and country music — but you can’t hit people over the head with it. You can comment, but you can’t preach.”","June 27, 1989"

Let's go down to the Sunset Grill
We can watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
Stare out at the auburn sky

There's an old man there from the old world
To him, it's all the same
Calls all his customers by name

Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

You see a lot more meanness in the city
It's the kind that eats you up inside
Hard to come away with anything that feels like dignity
Hard to get home with any pride

These days a man makes you somethin'
And you never see his face
But there is no hiding place
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill

Respectable little murders pay
They get more respectable every day
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna stick by you
And someday soon
We're gonna get in that car
And get outta here


Let's go down to the Sunset Grill
Watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
Gaze out at the auburn sky

Maybe we'll leave come springtime
Meanwhile, have another beer
What would we do without all these jerks anyway?
Besides, all our friends are here
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
1Embed","One of the follow-up singles to Henley’s 1984 smash “The Boys of Summer”, “Sunset Grill” is a remarkable observation of urban life and it’s dim, dismal outcomes and prospects. Using the initial setting of an ordinary hamburger restaurant, a contrast is drawn between the familiar nature of the eatery and the unpleasantly harsh conditions of the real world in the city.

A soaring, soulful synthesizer leads the song to a midway guitar-synth solo until the song climaxes into an ambitious brass, synth, et al. feud, ultimately creating a lush, quintessential 80’s arrangement.","November 19, 1984"

And she's seen a lot of tears
Of the ones who come in
They really seem to need her there
It's a sacrifice, working day to day
For little money, just tips for pay
But it's worth it all
Just to hear them say that they care

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money
So you better treat her right

She's seen her bad times
She already knows
These are the good times

Spring was never waiting for us, dear
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages, we were pressed
In love's hot fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, again

I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
The birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing
Chinese checkers by the trees

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, again

There will be another song for me
And I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it

I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun, yeah
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life, you'll still be the one

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers from the sky
Oh, and after all the loves of my life, yeah yeah
After all the loves in my life
You'll still be the one

Donna Summer,On the Radio,"On the Radio Lyrics
Someone found a letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name but I knew just who they meant

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered too
If, by chance, you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you

And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon

The song was famously used in the iconic opening scene of Francis Ford Coppola’s 1979 film Apocalypse Now, with images of the Vietnam War to the cinematic battle towards the end of the movie between Willard (Martin Sheen’s character) and Kurtz (Marlon Brando’s character).

In a 1969 interview with Rolling Stone, Morrison said the song means something different every time he listened to it:

It started out as a simple good-bye song… Probably just to a girl, but I see how it could be a goodbye to a kind of childhood. I really don’t know. I think it’s sufficiently complex and universal in its imagery that it could be almost anything you want it to be.

Riders on the storm53Embed","This was the last song Jim Morrison recorded. He went to France and died a few weeks later. The single was released in June, 1971, shortly before Morrison’s death.

This evolved out of a jam session when the band was messing around with “Ghost Riders In The Sky,” a cowboy song by Stan Jones. It was Jim Morrison’s idea to alter the title to “Riders On The Storm.”

Ray Manzarek used the electric piano to create the effect of rain.

If you listen closely, you can hear Jim Morrison whispering the lyrics over his own singing, which causes a kind of creepy effect.

This was Morrison’s final contribution as a rock star. Ray Manzarek told Uncut magazine September 2011: “There’s a whisper voice on ‘Riders on the Storm,’ if you listen closely, a whispered overdub that Jim adds beneath his vocal. That’s the last thing he ever did. An ephemeral, whispered overdub.”

The single was shortened for radio play. Some of the piano solo was cut out.

Snoop Dogg covered the song for the 2004 game, Need for Speed: Underground 2, in a remixed version produced by Fredwreck. The cover was dubbed over the original track.

Light My Fire was their first top charting hit, succeeding first as an LP track, then shortened by more than 4 minutes, and issued as a single. The song is consistently featured in various “greatest songs ever” lists, landing #35 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

The song perfectly combines Jim Morrison’s powerful voice with Robby Krieger’s guitar playing, and Ray Manzarek’s iconic organ riff and solo.

Ray Manzarek said in an interview with NPR about the song, but it was true for the whole album:

We were aware of Muddy Waters. We were aware of Howlin' Wolf and John Coltrane and Miles Davis. Plus, Jan and Dean and The Beach Boys and the surf sound. Robby Krieger brings in some flamenco guitar. I bring a little bit of classical music along with the blues and jazz, and certainly John Densmore was heavy into jazz. And Jim brings in beatnik poetry and French symbolist poetry, and that’s the blend of The Doors as the sun is setting into the Pacific Ocean at the end, the terminus of Western civilization. That’s the end of it. Western civilization ends here in California at Venice Beach, so we stood there inventing a new world on psychedelics.","April 1, 1967"

Drummer John Densmore recalled the moment in his 1991 biography, Riders on the Storm: My Life with Jim Morrison and The Doors:

[Morrison said] ‘Yeah, I feel really good about this one. It just came to me all of a sudden […] in a flash—as I was sitting up there on the ridge looking out over the city.’ His eyes were wild with excitement. ‘I scribbled it down as fast as I could. It felt great to be writing again.’ He looked down at the crumpled paper in his hand and sang the chorus in his haunting blues voice.

Morrison and Krieger are credited with writing the song. It reached #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 in October 1967.","September 1, 1967"

Or just another lost angel?

Based on content alone, I’m guessing Muddy was a fan.

The Doors,Break On Through (To the Other Side),"Break On Through (To the Other Side) Lyrics
You know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run, tried to hide

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side, yeah

We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
A-can you still recall time we cried?

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side

Hey!
Come on, yeah

Everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby
She get high
She get high
She get high
She get high, yeah
I found an island in your arms
Country in your eyes
Arms that chained us, eyes that lied

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, ow!
Aw yeah!

Made the scene, week to week
Day to day, hour to hour
Gate is straight, deep and wide

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, break on through
Break on through, break on through
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah25Embed","This is the quintessential Doors song.
Vivid with exceptional imagery, drug use metaphor, psychedelic musical composition, and amazing vocals, this is a great example of everything The Doors do the best, and all on the same track.

Jim Morrison was way into his psychedelics, and this is most likely a reference on LSD use, and the presumption that it helps users to have that breakthrough… Getting out of (social) reality, drawing new connections and acquiring a clearer image of what’s going on. After such an epiphany, one could claim that they passed on to the other side.

It’s worth mentioning that the name The Doors itself, was inspired by Aldous Huxley’s novel The Doors of Perception which contains accounts of the author’s mescaline trips. Aldous Huxley borrowed the title of his book from a stanza in William Blake’s The Marriage of Heaven and Hell","January 4, 1967"
The Doors,Touch Me,"Touch Me Lyrics
Yeah!

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Now touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?
Now, I'm going to love you
'Til the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
'Til the stars fall from the sky
For you and I

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Now touch me, babe
Can't you see that I am not afraid?
What was that promise that you made?
Why won't you tell me what she said?
What was that promise that you made?
Now, I'm going to love you
'Til the heavens stop the rain
I'm going to love you
'Til the stars fall from the sky
For you and  I

I'm going to love you
