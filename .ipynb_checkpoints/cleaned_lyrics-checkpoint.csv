ken nordine,yellow,"in the beginning
oh long before that
when light was deciding
who should be in
and who should be out
of the spectrum
yellow was in trouble
even then it seems that green
(you know how green can be)
didnt want yellow in
some silly primal envy i suppose
but for whatever cause
the effect was bad on yellow
and caused yellow to weep yellow tears
for several eternals
before there were years
until blue heard what was up
between green and yellow
and took green aside for a serious talk
in which blue pointed out
that if yellow and blue were to get together
not that they would but if they did
(a gentle threat)
they could make their own green
""ohhh"" said green with some understanding
naturally by a sudden change of hue
green saw the light and yellow got in
it worked out fine
yellow got lemons
and green got limes",?,"January 1, 1966",1966
ken nordine,green,"as an intellectual vibration smack dab in the middle of spectrum
green can be a problem
that’s because there’s so many different greens inside of green and each one has a different iq
there’s the green that should never have happened
the “stupid green”
the green that is “green with envy”
then there’s the “soso green” the “whocaresanyway” green
but somewhere in green is a green here and there that has something to say
a truly intelligent green a green with some integrity
that’s the kind of green for you and me
there’s a green to be seen with vivid vibrant living alive
we should spend the better part of our time yours and mine with a green like this
maybe some of it would rub off",?,"January 1, 1966",1966
ken nordine,what time is it?,"there was this guy who was a regular guy who lived a regular life
got up 730 every morning
had the same breakfast
kissed the same wife goodbye every morning
went to the same office
came home  monday through friday
on saturdays he played with the children
did handywork around the house
sundays he took the family out on the station wagon to the suburbs
and there they looked at the houses and the trees the billboards the gasoline stations and the railroad crossings
and his life might have gone on like this forever
except one night something strange happened to him
you see he went to bed at 1030
and some of his friends stayed up later
and one of them closing up a place that closed at two in the morning decided to call this ""regular liver""
and said ""what time is it"" on the telephone
when he woke up and he said ""whos this whos this its its its two oclock in the morning its no time to call bye""
but the practical joker called every night two oclock in the morning
he did this for two weeks
friend  said ""who is it stop""
finally after two weeks the practical joker lost interest in the joke and did stop
then came two oclock and the phone didnt ring
so he woke up
""why isnt the phone ringing""
he discovered that the only way that he could go back to sleep was to say ""what time is it""
look at his watch and say ""two oclock""
and he could sleep
he did this a couple of nights until he began to think
""its two oclock where i am
what time is it in new york or in hollywood
or in london or in hong kong and cairo""
he didnt know
so the next day he went out and he bought himself some clocks
he got clocks from all over and he put them all over the walls
and the time was there
he knew what time it was everywhere that counted
and this made him feel comfortable
he became so interested in time that he got little egg timers and gave them away as presents
he read about time in in books
sidereal time time way out in the universe
he knew what time it was on arcturus and the pleiades and the milky way
one night though at two oclock in the morning the light wouldnt go on the fuse had blown
but suddenly he realized he knew what time it was without even looking
not only in the important cities of this world but in the entire universe
and naturally began to brag a little the next day
he told people ""i know what time it is""
and they tested him and he did know
the administration had changed at this particular time and they wanted to save money
so they got rid of all their astronomers all their telescopes their weights and measures
and they put this man in washington in a little room
where he sits to this day simply saying
""beep the time now is""",?,July 1957,1957

when are you gonna set my soul free","The only track on Power-Fuerza not written by the Ghetto Brothers, “Girl from the Mountain” is in fact a cover of a song written by Felix Tollinchi and originally recorded by The Harvey Averne Barrio Band for their self-titled 1971 record. The Averne record itself features a Tito Puente cover, for whom the Ghetto Brothers opened in an earlier incarnation nearly eight years before – one possible explanation for how the group decided to cover this relatively obscure track. But there is at least one other interesting connection between The Harvey Averne Barrio Band and the Ghetto Brothers. Averne was “one of several prominent Jewish Americans in New York’s bustling Latin music scene” – and so was Ghetto Brothers founder and bandleader Benji Melendez.

Though Melendez was Latino and in fact born in Puerto Rico (unlike Averne, who had no Latin or Hispanic heritage), Benji was also a crypto-Jew. On March 30th, 1492, Queen Isabella of Spain issued an expulsion decree giving Jews just four months to leave the country. Hundreds of thousands of people were expelled or murdered during this time. To avoid death, many Jews converted to Christianity, with some continuing to secretly practice Judaism. Nevertheless, during the Spanish Inquisition, many these hidden Jews, or “marranos” (Spanish word for pigs), were found and killed. Those that survived or fled continued to practice Judaism in secret, passing down rituals and traditions over generations. Growing up, Melendez recognized that his family had certain routines that were different from other families in their neighborhood, such as reading the Old Scripture on Saturdays, or how his father would “wrap himself into a bed sheet and mediate” on Fridays. It was not until Melendez was older that he realized his family’s unique traditions were in fact Jewish traditions, thanks to the help of a former teacher, Rita Fecher, who was Jewish herself. Although Melendez did not discover this truth about his family’s heritage until later in his life, it became a large part of his identity, and he attended the Intervale Jewish Center, the last synagogue of the South Bronx, until it closed.

viva puerto rico libre","Benji Melendez’s family moved from Puerto Rico to New York in the late 1950s. Feeling ties to both the island and his new home where he grew up, Melendez considered himself to be Nuyorican. The song’s calls to “never forget that we are Boricuas” exemplifies his, and the rest of the Ghetto Brothers', desire to remember that heritage.

The Ghetto Brothers, whether as a band, gang, or community organization, were always involved in politics, and “Viva Puerto Rico Libre” is but one example of their engagement with the Puerto Rican independence movement. Ghetto Brothers' founder was inspired to create the group in part due to an interest in the Puerto Rican Socialist Party (PSP), one of several pro-independence, revolutionary political groups which operated in Puerto Rico and New York in the 1960s and 1970s. Where the PSP advocated for a total break with the US and its imperialist and capitalist policies, “Viva Puerto Rico Libre” is notably less political, calling only for Puerto Rico’s liberty. But lest the Ghetto Brothers be misread as shying away from overtly political messaging, one might refer to a televised speech given by Benjy Melendez in 1971, in which he stated:

We are being oppressed by the North American Yanqui. We the Puerto Ricans should rise up and defend ourselves against these dogs who will oppress us, and liberate our country from capitalism and imperialism. The North American is trying to steal our identity as Puerto Ricans, and call us Americans. We Puerto Ricans are Puerto Ricans from the day we are born until the day we die.”

(gather round now im bout to kick the flavor)
(alright here it go)
(verse 1)
guess what when i was a young boy up in the south bronx
i never carried a gun was knocking out chumps
punks all faggots plus sissies and creeps
you get in my face jack ill lay you out in the streets
with no weapons yall not a chain or a bat
but ill slap you upside ya head like my hand was your hat
you see so many have tried many have died
and if you mess with busy bee you might as well commit suicide
sssusususuusuusuicide
you mess with me you just committed suicide
not a homicide but a suicide
(verse 2)
the champion of knowledge wisdom understanding
if this was spoken then you all would throw your hand it
if rap was a crime the rhyme would be libel
if rap was a book then my mouth would be the bible
my rhymes are crescendo a verbal assault
talk it up innuendo but its not my fault
by no means commercial highly controversial
no practice or rehearsal you mess with me i hurt you
i slay you in the mud you dud with no trouble
and bathe in your blood i get with mr bubble
use the scar for a pillow and at the end of the day
just like calgon they have to take you away
im gonna bury your remains in six feet up soil
youre looking kinda rusty boy you need some oil
your family is sad your family cried
cuz you messed with busy bee so you just committed suicide
sssusususuusuusuicide
you mess with me you just committed suicide
not a homicide but a suicide
(verse 3)
iwaswalking down the street mindin my own biz
the mcs didnt know what time it is
after the battle the boy just cried
i said you was better off if you just commit suicide
paid with your life and fought mike tyson
pour rap poison with your beans and rice
and got bit by a rat or hit by a bat
go smoke some crack you already tried that
jump off a plane fall out the train
call my mama names you must be insane
go wrestle alligators in the everglades
go sleep with somebody who just caught aids
let a pit bull bite you let me dynamite you
swim in gasoline and let my homeboy light you
drink some arsenic or sip some cyanide
or mess with me and you will commit suicide
sssusususuusuusuicide
you mess with me you just committed suicide
not a homicide but a suicide
(im getting ready to kick a little favor now lay down the law)
(verse 4)
rip somebody off is a robbery
breaking in their house is the burglary
stealing their car is grand larceny
lying in court is perjury
selling your body is prostitution
got to go to court just to find a solution
killing somebody is a homicide
but if you mess with me thats stone cold suicide
sssusususuusuusuicide
you mess with me then you just committed suicide
my name is busy bee and ill never lie

a young nigga got it bad cause im brown

they have the authority to kill a minority
fuck that shit cause i aint the one
for a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
to be beating on and thrown in jail
we can go toetotoe in the middle of a cell
fuckin with me cause im a teenager
with a little bit of gold and a pager
searchin my car lookin for the product
thinkin every nigga is sellin narcotics
youd rather see me in the pen
than me and lorenzo rollin in a benzo
beat a police out of shape
and when im finished bring the yellow tape
to tape off the scene of the slaughter
still getting swole off bread and water
i dont know if they fags or what
search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
and on the other hand without a gun they cant get none
but dont let it be a black and a white one
cause theyll slam ya down to the street top
black police showing out for the white cop
ice cube will swarm
on any motherfucker in a blue uniform
just cause im from the cpt
punk police are afraid of me huh
a young nigga on the warpath
and when im finished its gonna be a bloodbath
of cops dying in la

cause i feel like it
just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up
man fuck this shit
alright smartass im taking your black ass to jail
mc ren will you please give your testimony
to the jury about this fucked up incident

fuck the police and ren said it with authority
because the niggas on the street is a majority
a gang is with whoever im steppin
and the motherfuckin weapon is kept in
a stash spot for the socalled law
wishing ren was a nigga that they never saw
lights start flashing behind me
but theyre scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
but that shit dont work i just laugh
because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
for police im saying ""fuck you punk""
reading my rights and shit its all junk
pulling out a silly club so you stand
with a fakeass badge and a gun in your hand
but take off the gun so you can see whats up
and well go at it punk and ima fuck you up
make you think ima kick your ass
but drop your gat and rens gonna blast
im sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
but ima smoke em now and not next time
smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
or any asshole that threatens me
im a sniper with a hell of a scope
takin out a cop or two they cant cope with me
the motherfuckin villain thats mad
with potential to get bad as fuck
so ima turn it around
put in my clip yo and this is the sound (*gunshots*)
yeah somethin like that
but it all depends on the size of the gat
takin out a police would make my day
but a nigga like ren dont give a fuck to say

fuck the police fuck the— fuck the—
fuck the police fuck the— fuck—

eazye wont you step up to the stand
and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit
im tired of the motherfuckin jackin
sweating my gang while im chillin in the shack and
shining the light in my face and for what
maybe its because i kick so much butt
i kick ass or maybe cause i blast
on a stupid ass nigga when im playing with the trigger
of an uzi or an ak
cause the police always got somethin stupid to say
they put out my picture with silence
cause my identity by itself causes violence
the e with the criminal behavior
yeah im a gangsta but still i got flavor
without a gun and a badge what do you got
a sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
by me or another nigga
and with a gat it dont matter if hes smaller or bigger
(size dont mean shit hes from the old school fool)
and as you all know es here to rule
whenever im rollin keep lookin in the mirror

fuck the police","“Fuck tha Police” takes the form of a trial against the LAPD, with Dr. Dre, MC Ren, and Ice Cube as judge, court officer, and witness.

Dr. Dre explained the song was created after the members of N.W.A were forced by police to lay face down in the street with guns to their heads.
However, the reason why the police were harassing them was because Eazy-E was doing drive-bys shootings on innocent people on bus stops with a paintball gun, as Dre explained in the HBO Documentary The Defiant Ones.

The song caught the attention of the FBI, which sent a letter to Priority Records about N.W.A’s album. Although the FBI did not refer to “Fuck The Police” by name, their letter claimed the album “encourages violence against and disrespect for the law enforcement officer.

The instrumental heard during the court house skit, samples Public Enemy’s “Bring The Noise”.

In a 2015 interview with DJ Vlad, DJ Yella claimed the song only took a day to make.","August 8, 1988",1988

n.w.a,express yourself,"
yo man its a lot of brothers out there flakin and perpetratin but scared to kick reality
man youve been doin all this dope producing you aint had a chance to show em what time it is
so what you want me to do (express yourself)

im expressing with my full capabilities
and now im living in correctional facilities
cause some dont agree with how i do this
i get straight meditate like a buddhist
im dropping flavor my behavior is hereditary
but my technique is very necessary
blame it on ice cube because he says it gets funky
when you got a subject and a predicate
add it on a dope beat and thatll make you think
some suckers just tickle me pink
to my stomach cause they dont flow like this one
you know what i wont hesitate to dis one
or two before im through so dont try to sing this
some drop science well im dropping english
even if yella makes it a cappella
i still express yo i dont smoke weed or sess
cause its known to give a brother brain damage
and brain damage on the mic dont manage nothing
but making a sucker and you equal dont be another sequel
express yourself (ah ah ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah)
express yourself (smoke smoke)
come on and do it (yeah kick it over here)
express yourself (do it do it )
express yourself
come on and do it

now getting back to the pg
thats program and its easy
dre is back new jacks are made hollow
expressing aint their subject because they like to follow
the words the style the trend the records i spin
again and again and again yo you on the other end
watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
theres no fessing and guessing while im expressing myself
its crazy to see people be
what society wants them to be but not me
ruthless is the way to go they know
others say rhymes that fail to be original
or they kill where the hiphop starts
forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
some musicians cuss at home
but scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
yeah they want reality but you wont hear none
they rather exaggerate a little fiction
some say no to drugs and take a stand
but after the show they go looking for the dopeman
or they ban my group from the radio hear nwa and say ""hell no""
but you know it aint all about wealth as long as you make a note to
express yourself (yeah yeah yeah )
express yourself
come on and do it (yeah yeah do it)
express yourself (dr dre dr dre in full effect and nwa)
express yourself
come on and do it
express yourself

from the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
then expression is a big part of it
you aint efficient when you flow
you aint swift moving like a tortoise full of rigor mortis
theres a little bit more to show
i got rhymes in my mind embedded like an embryo
or a lesson all of em expression
and if you start fessing i got a smith and wesson for you
i might ignore your record because it has no bottom
i get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
its dre on the mic getting physical
doing the job nwa is the lynch mob
yes im macabre but you know you need this
and the knowledge is growing just like a fetus
or a tumor but heres the rumor
dre is in the neighborhood and hes up to no good
when i start expressing myself yella slam it
cause if i stay funky like this im doing damage
or imma be too hyped and need a straight jacket
i got knowledge and other suckers lack it
so when you see dre a dj on the mic
ask what its like its like we getting hype tonight
cause if i strike it aint for your good health
but i wont strike if you just
express yourself (yeah yeah this records almost over almost over gotta get hyped up)
express yourself (do it do it)
come on and do it (do it do it do it)

motherfuckin jheri curl light ambi wearing motherfuckin bitch","“No Vaseline” is Ice Cube’s diss track about his former group N.W.A and their manager, Jerry Heller.

Cube left N.W.A in 1989 over financial issues, and the group took shots at him on their 1990 EP 100 Miles & Runnin' and their 1991 album Niggaz4Life, particularly on their songs “Real Niggaz” and “Message to B.A..”

Producer Sir Jinx revealed the following information about the creation of the song:

We had “No Vaseline” in AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted—he just didn’t put it on the record. Then we did Kill At Will. And then [N.W.A.] started dissin’ Cube, and then that’s why we [said], “It ain’t over!” And that’s the last song on Death Certificate, ’cause we never wanted to beef with [Dr.] Dre and them. It wasn’t like that. The crowd saw it like that, but it was not like that. It was only [Ice Cube standing up for himself].

On “No Vaseline,” Cube responds and addresses Eazy-E and Jerry Heller with particularly harsh words, accusing them of unfairly exploiting the group. He refers to Heller as a “Jew,” and suggests that the group murder him—a move that motivated a prominent Jewish Rights Organization to boycott Cube’s music.

Cube’s wordplay, airing of dirty laundry, and passionate anger made “No Vaseline” one of the most celebrated battle rap songs ever. The song’s beat was produced by Cube and Sir Jinx, who sampled “Dazz” by ’70s funk band Brick.

N.W.A. never responded to “No Vaseline.” About a year after the song was released, the group effectively broke up when Dre left Ruthless Records for many of the same reasons Cube did.

Dre (and Snoop Doggy Dogg) responded to Cube on 1993’s “Fuck Wit Dre Day (And Everybody’s Celebratin’)”:

Then we gonna creep to South Central
On a street knowledge mission as I steps in the temple 
Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat
You trying to check my homey, you better check yourself
Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself, motherfucker

“No Vaseline” was later included on the Death Row Greatest Hits album, after Dre had split with the label. It’s widely believed Suge Knight released the track (and a related EP) as a dig at his ex-partner. The Death Row version omits the minute long intro and censors the word “Jew.” For similar reasons, the UK release of Death Certificate omitted the song altogether.

In the 2015 biopic Straight Outta Compton, “No Vaseline” is prominently featured in a particularly memorable scene that shows Eazy, Dre, Ren, Yella, and Jerry Heller reacting to hearing the song for the first time. Sir Jinx spoke further about Dre’s reaction:

Me and Dre done talked about it, and a couple of niggas got they ass whooped playing that song. You pulled up to Dre playin’ around…he might drag you out that car, jack. But, you know, [Dr. Dre is] my cousin—and you know I had the #1 song in [the movie] Straight Outta Compton, so it’s over with, you know?","October 29, 1991",1991

yeah
yeah
yeah

just wakin up in the morning gotta thank god
i dont know but today seems kinda odd
no barking from the dog no smog
and momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
i got my grub on but didnt pig out
finally got a call from a girl i wanna dig out
hooked it up for later as i hit the door
thinkin ""will i live another twentyfour""
i gotta go cause i got me a droptop
and if i hit the switch i can make the ass drop
had to stop at a red light
lookin in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
and everything is alright
i got a beep from kim and she can fuck all night
called up the homies and im askin yall
""which park are yall playin basketball""
get me on the court and im trouble
last week fucked around and got a triple double
freakin niggas every way like mj
i cant believe today was a good day
drove to the pad and hit the showers
didnt even get no static from the cowards
cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
saw the police and they rolled right past me
no flexin didnt even look in a niggas direction
as i ran the intersection
went to short dogs house they was watchin yo mtv raps
whats the haps on the craps
shake em up shake em up shake em up shake em
roll em in a circle of niggas
and watch me break em with the 7 711 711
7 even back door little joe
i picked up the cash flow
then we played bones and im yellin ""domino""
plus nobody i know got killed in south central la
today was a good day

left my niggas house paid
picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
its ironic i had the brew she had the chronic
the lakers beat the supersonics
i felt on the big fat fanny
pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
and my dick runs deep so deep
so deep put her ass to sleep
woke her up around one
she didnt hesitate to call ice cube the top gun
drove her to the pad and im coastin
took another sip of the potion hit the threewheel motion
i was glad everything had worked out
dropped her ass off and then chirped out
today was like one of those fly dreams
didnt even see a berry flashin those high beams
no helicopter lookin for a murder
two in the morning got the fatburger
even saw the lights of the goodyear blimp
and it read ""ice cubes a pimp"" (yeah)
drunk as hell but no throwin up
halfway home and my pager still blowin up
today i didnt even have to use my ak
i gotta say it was a good day
hey wait wait a minute
pooh stop this shit
what the fuck am i thinkin about","Ice Cube describes his ideal day: a pork-free breakfast, Yo MTV Raps!, gambling, and a sexual rendezvous.

In 2012, a blogger calculated the exact day that Ice Cube describes in the song: January 20, 1992. The post generated a ton of publicity, eventually inspiring an internet campaign to put Ice Cube’s name on an actual blimp. The campaign was successful, and on January 20, 2014, Goodyear flew Ice Cube’s blimp over South Central, raising $25,000 for charity in the process.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4UqMyldS7Q

The song is featured prominently in the game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. It samples “Footsteps in the Dark” by the Isley Brothers.

Ice Cube has said in interviews that he liked to end his shows with this song. People would get riled up during the concert with his more aggressive songs, and he didn’t want them to leave the venue with that mentality. So he’d end with this mellow song to chill them out and reduce the odds of them doing something violent.","November 17, 1992",1992

Ice Cube addresses the often held sentiment that gangsta rap (and one could argue, hip-hop in general), is directly responsible for many problems in today’s society. He does this throughout the song with absurd implications correlating dysfunctional behavior to listening to gangsta rap, “proving” that gangsta rap is the root of all problems. Ironically, the mental gymnastics Ice Cube’s lyrics take are not far from actual arguments posited by rap’s critics.","January 3, 2008",2008

gunit","“In da Club” was the first of seven tracks 50 Cent recorded with Dr. Dre in only five days. Originally planned as a D12 song for the 8 Mile soundtrack, producer Dr Dre played the instrumental for 50 who immediately wrote the song’s lyrics within an hour and recorded the bulk of the vocals that night.

According to The Billboard Book Of Number 1 Hits, when choosing which song should be Get Rich or Die Tryin's lead single, Eminem favored “If I Can’t”. But when 50 asked Dre for his opinion, he opted for “In da Club” instead. After a coin toss, “In da Club” was chosen.

“In da Club” was loved by music critics and fans alike, propelling the song to #1 in seven countries including the US in the spring of 2003. Eventually the song was certified platinum in four countries. It is one of 50 Cent’s most recognizable and well-known songs.","January 7, 2003",2003

The song features a smooth, string-based instrumental from Turbo and Ghetto Guitar.

“Sold Out Dates” was originally leaked online. Following the leak, Gunna officially released the song on his YouTube channel. For months, fans (incorrectly) assumed it was the lead single from Drip Harder, Baby and Gunna’s debut collaborative album. However, the song will remain a standalone single.","April 17, 2018",2018

surfin usa","“Surfin' U.S.A.” is notable for giving the Beach Boys their first widespread success with its title track, and for Brian Wilson’s increasing prowess in songwriting, as well as vocal arrangement. The fuller-sounding vocals were achieved using double tracking, creating The Beach Boys' own unique sound. As with “Surfin' Safari”, some have speculated that “Surfin' U.S.A.” was not produced by Nick Venet, the officially listed producer, but by Brian Wilson.

This track featured lyrics by Brian Wilson, who intentionally set them to the music of “Sweet Little Sixteen,” by Chuck Berry, as he was inspired by that song. However, under pressure from Berry’s publisher and with threats of lawsuit, Wilson’s father and manager, Murry Wilson, gave the copyright for the song to Arc Music, Berry’s publisher.

It’s notable that “Fun, Fun, Fun,” another hit for The Beach Boys, sampled heavily from another of Berry’s songs, “Johnny B. Goode.”","March 4, 1963",1963

“God Only Knows” was composed and produced by Brian Wilson. Tony Asher helped Brian with the lyrics. Carl Wilson sang lead, and Bruce Johnston sang harmony vocals with Brian in the outro.

The song broke new ground in many ways. It was one of the first commercial songs to use the word ‘God’ in its title. As producer, Brian Wilson used many unorthodox instruments, including the harpsichord and French horns that are heard in the song’s famous introduction.

Although The Beatles engaged in a friendly rivalry with the Beach Boys based on mutual respect, Paul McCartney called this song the best song ever written.","July 18, 1966",1966
the beach boys,wouldn’t it be nice,"
wouldnt it be nice if we were older
then we wouldnt have to wait so long
and wouldnt it be nice to live together
in the kind of world where we belong
you know its gonna make it that much better
when we can say goodnight and stay together

wouldnt it be nice if we could wake up
in the morning when the day is new
after having spent the day together
hold each other close the whole night through

but happy times together weve been spending
i wish that every kiss was neverending
oh wouldnt it be nice

maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
oh baby then there wouldnt be a single thing we couldnt do
oh we could be married (oh we could be married)
and then wed be happy (and then wed be happy)
oh wouldnt it be nice
you know it seems the more we talk about it
it only makes it worse to live without it
but lets talk about it
but wouldnt it be nice

goodnight my baby
sleep tight my baby
goodnight my baby
sleep tight my baby
goodnight my baby
sleep tight my baby","The opening track of Pet Sounds was later released as the  albums' third single with “God Only Knows” as its B-Side.

Listen for the rockin' accordions and the ethereal guitars in the introduction. Tony and I had visualized a scene. We had a feeling in our hearts, like a vibration. We put it into music, and it found its way onto tape. We really felt good about that record.
- Brian Wilson

The song was written with young people in mind and expresses the “never grow old” mentality.

Wouldn’t It Be Nice' was not a real long song, but it’s a very ‘up’ song. It expresses the frustrations of youth, what you can’t have, what you really want and you have to wait for it. The need to have the freedom to live with somebody. The idea is, the more we talk about it, the more we want it, but let’s talk about it anyway.
- Brian Wilson","July 18, 1966",1966

When he was a child, his mother told him that dogs could pick up “vibrations” from people, so that the dog would bark at “bad vibrations”. Wilson turned this into the general idea of vibrations (and Mike Love putting “good” in front of vibrations), and developed the idea of people being able to do the same with emotions.

This song is revolutionary in a couple of ways. Firstly, the song is a for the time unusual form:
A B A' B C D B E
There is a lot of new material (C, D and E), where most previous songs only had A’s and B’s and sometimes a bridge. Furthermore, these new parts are not in obvious ways musically connected to previous parts.
Second, there is a ton of instruments that were completely new to this type of music, most notably an Electro-Theremin. This song and the album Pet Sounds in general greatly influenced the Beatles, which resulted in Sgt. Pepper.","October 10, 1966",1966

Written by Elton and his co-songwriter Bernie Taupin, “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” is about wanting to give up a life of opulence for a simpler life away from all the glitz and glamour. Since Elton himself was living deep in the high life at the time, it can be said that this message is more relevant to Bernie than Elton, for he was often the guy that preferred to keep it low key compared to his more famous partner.

It is one of Elton John’s most famous and commercially successful singles, topping the Canadian RPM 100 Top Singles Chart and peaking at #2 on the US Billboard Top 100. It’s also considered one of the best songs he’s ever made.","October 5, 1973",1973

After Lauper had already recorded the large majority of her debut album—She’s So Unusual—her producer Rick Chertoff insisted she needed “one more song.” Chertoff introduced her to Hyman and they began working on the song.

Lauper came up with the title while reading TV Guide—Time After Time was a 1979 science fiction movie starring Malcolm McDowell as H. G. Wells, portraying him inventing a time traveling machine.

Lauper’s label initially wanted this song to be her first single before she convinced them to go with “Girls Just Want To Have Fun.” In her memoir, Lauper recounts:

When the album was completed, the label wanted the first single to be “Time After Time.” But I kept saying to them, “Listen to me—releasing a ballad first defines you in a certain way. You become known as a balladeer, and it can kill your career.”","January 27, 1984",1984

The song became Lauper’s second and final #1 in the US in late 1986. It also was a huge hit internationally, reaching the top 20 in eight other countries including a #12 peak in the UK.

“True Colors” has been covered by many artists including The Weeknd and Phil Collins, who had success with it overseas. The song has also been found in mainstream pop culture many times, from late 80s Kodak commercials to the 2016 film Trolls where it is sung by Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick.

Lauper had a friend who’d recently died of AIDS in mind while singing “True Colors”, and over time the song has grown to become an anthem for the LGBT-community. In 2015 Cyndi Lauper opened a shelter for homeless gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender youth. The shelter was named after this song.

The True Colors Residence, named after her 1986 hit “True Colors,” will be located on West 154th St. near Frederick Douglass Blvd. in Harlem. The residence, the first permanent housing facility of its kind in the city, was conceived by the singer, her manager and the West End Intergenerational Residence, a non-profit focused on providing housing for homeless families and the elderly.","August 25, 1986",1986

The song was Lauper’s debut single, breakout hit and remains one of her signature songs. It reached the top 5 around the world in early 1984.

walk like an egyptian
walk like an egyptian","Walk Like an Egyptian was a million-selling single and became Billboard’s number-one song of 1987.  Nevertheless, the song ended up accelerating the tensions within the group. The original plan for this song called for Debbi Peterson to sing the whole thing, but their producer, David Kahne, decided to have one person sing one verse. There are only three verses, though, so one person would have to get left out. That person ended up being Debbi Peterson, when David Kahne decided to have Micki Steele sing the second verse instead of Debbi (Vicki Peterson sang the first verse and Susanna Hoffs sang the third). Debbi didn’t play drums on the song either, when the producer decided that drum machines were the hip sound of 1987 (which they kinda were – ‘87 was a weird time).

Like most Bangles hits, the Bangles didn’t write this one.  This one’s written by Liam Sternberg.   Over the years, the song has shown up in dozens of movies and TV shows.","January 2, 1986",1986

With this song and “Walk Like an Egyptian”, the Bangles became only the third girl group to score multiple #1s in the United States, after the Supremes (12) and the Shirelles (2).

Steinberg explains the song’s origins:

Susanna was talking about the Bangles having visited Graceland, and she said there was some type of shrine to Elvis that included some kind of eternal flame. As soon as those words were mentioned, I immediately thought of the synagogue in the town of Palm Springs, California where I grew up. I remember during our Sunday school class they would walk us through the sanctuary. There was one little red light and they told us it was called the eternal flame.","February 17, 1989",1989

It became their internationally-successful breakthrough hit, reaching #2 in the US, UK, Germany & Austria, #4 in Switzerland & Norway and #5 in New Zealand.

Prince’s own version was officially released on a 2019 compilation titled Originals which is full of songs he wrote but are best-known as being performed by other artists, such as The Time “Jungle Love”, Sheila E “The Glamorous Life” and Sinead O'Connor “Nothing Compares 2 U”.","January 27, 1986",1986

The song was released in March 1993 as the second single, after the international hit “Ordinary World”, from the album and it had a considerable success, entering in the top ten in all the most relevant charts in the world and reaching number one in Israel. “Come Undone”, as well as the previous single, is supposed to be a significant marker of Duran Duran’s entry in adult contemporary radio format.

The instrumentation, substained by a sample of the legendary instrumental break “Ashley’s Roachclip” by The Soul Searchers, was cured by Warren Cuccurullo, the group’s guitarist at the time, whereas the lyrics were written by the lead singer Simon Le Bon as a gift for his wife Yasmin. Even though this is one of the best-known songs of the band, it was added to The Wedding Album only during the last recording sessions, as it was originally recorded for a side-project by Nick Rhodes!","February 23, 1993",1993

Lyrically, it was inspired by the fairy tale, Little Red Riding Hood, while sonically, fiddling around with burgeoning technologies such as Roland’s 808 and Jupiter 8 keyboard produced the distinctive groove, according to a 2003 interview with the band for Blender Magazine.

The song was the group’s breakout hit in the US and Canada. In early 1983, it topped the chart in Canada and became their first of nine top 5 hits in the States, peaking at #3. They’d already been in the top 40 four times in their homeland the UK, where this one reached #5.","May 10, 1982",1982

In Wannabe: How the Spice Girls Reinvented Pop Fame, Rowe remembers the impression they left on him that day:

I loved them. Immediately.  The studio was pretty small, and they all sat on one chair on each other’s laps in a line. I don’t know how they managed it…They were like no one I’d met before, really.

The song was written and recorded quickly.  Victoria missed the writing session for the track, though tried to pitch in over the phone. The song’s divvied up among the girls equally, except for Victoria, who contributed only backing vocals to the track. She regretted missing out. In her 2004 autobiography Learning to Fly, she recalled:

I just couldn’t bear not being there. Because whatever they said about how it didn’t matter, it did matter.

The label did not like the first outcome of the song, and got producer Dave Way to give the track an R&B influenced backing track. The group didn’t think this was the right vibe, and eventually sent it to be mixed by Mark Stent. This became the final version of the song.

Their label, Virgin Records, wanted “Say You’ll Be There” to be the band’s debut single, however the group fought for this song. Eventually got their way.

“Wannabe” lyrics addresses the value of female friendship over a female-male bond. It soon after became an iconic symbol of female empowerment and one of the group’s most popular songs.","June 26, 1996",1996

M.I.L.F. is a commonly used acronym that stands for “Mother I’d Like To F***.” However, Fergie has expressed a desire to see it changed to the less objectifying “Moms I’d Like To Follow.”  The music video subliminally features this alternate reading many times.

The title uses symbols to play on another double meaning: “MILF Money” and the plural, “MILFS.” Fergie uses the lyric “MILF money” throughout the song to refer to her status as a high-earning, independent, and sexy mother. The second meaning for “MILFS” refers to her dedication of the song to all MILFs and their hustle, particularly the other women in her celebrity crew.

Hours after the premiere of this song, Fergie released the music video which features Hollywood’s “hottest” moms.

Kim Kardashian, who is included in the video spoke about the song on her website saying:

Do you guys see those 10-inch gold heels I had to wear in the milk shower?! It was not easy, but I think it looks hot. We literally shot this all day, then I got on a plane and flew to New York to shoot the GQ cover the next morning. It was the craziest week!","June 25, 2016",2016

It is a possible love ode about Rodrigo moving on from her previous relationship with Joshua Bassett, who is now supposedly dating Sabrina Carpenter, by doing the one last thing that she promised him—getting a driver’s license. The song showcases a brilliant balance of unfiltered outpouring and graceful specificity. Its accompanying music video spins a vivid portrait of Rodrigo as she drives aimlessly, longing for an ex-love.

The song was teased several times before its release in January 2021. On July 23, 2020, Olivia posted a snippet of the song on Instagram with the caption “wrote dis the other day. vv close to my heart. gonna call it drivers license I think lol.” She then posted another two snippets in December 2020, captioning them with “soon” and “sooner.” On January 4, 2021, she announced the song as her debut single.","January 8, 2021",2021

Olivia questions both the authenticity of her ex’s new relationship, as well as their emotions for their new girl. She also portrays feelings of pity towards this new girl, who is not experiencing anything unique with her now-lover.

Despite sharing similar themes, “deja vu” is musically different from “drivers license,” with a more upbeat melody. It shows influences from Taylor Swift, both melodically and lyrically, especially in the bridge and outro—an interpolation of Taylor’s August 2019 song “Cruel Summer” was officially credited months after release. The music video shows Olivia spying on another woman—played by actress Talia Ryder—and emulating her life out of adoration, including wearing nearly identical clothing, traveling to the same locations, and copying her actions. Eventually, the woman makes it known that she was aware of Olivia’s stalkery the entire time, and taunts her, leaving Olivia enraged.

In the week preceding its release, Olivia cleared all of her posts on her Instagram account and began posting a series of cryptic videos, showing various clips on an analog television. Three of these teasers were shared before the official announcement of the song on March 29, 2021. The day before its release, Olivia posted an acoustic snippet of the song on TikTok.","April 1, 2021",2021

but i guess good for you

well good for you i guess you moved on really easily","“good 4 u” is the third single from Olivia Rodrigo’s debut studio album, SOUR. The song’s hook is laced with sarcasm, as Olivia sharply addresses her former partner for quickly moving on from their relationship without much of an issue or any care towards her at all. Like with her previous single, “deja vu,” Olivia again experiments musically, this time using drums and a guitar as primary instruments to emphasize her anger building up as the song progresses. Its angsty, pop-rock sound has drawn comparisons to 2000s acts like Paramore and Avril Lavigne.

In the music video, Olivia plays a high school cheerleader who is feeling distraught and vindictive over her former partner. She purchases a container of gasoline from a convenience store and appears to destroy her ex’s bedroom, setting it ablaze and causing it to flood. In the final shot, Olivia submerges herself into a lake with glowing red eyes—a subtle homage to the 2009 cult classic Jennifer’s Body in which Jennifer stares into the camera with bloodshot eyes while swimming in a lake.

Olivia first teased the song and its music video on April 26, 2021, by posting an Instagram photo showing her dressed as a cheerleader. On May 9, 2021, the song was revealed to be her next single in SOUR’s album trailer shown at theatrical screenings of In The Heights. The next day, its release was officially announced by Olivia on Instagram.

In the US, “good 4 u” debuted at #1 on May 29, 2021, her second chart-topper there. In the UK, it debuted at #2, then held the top spot for five weeks – the most by a guitar-driven song since the four weeks spent by Evanescence’s “Bring Me To Life” in 2003. The song has also topped pop charts in over a dozen more countries around the world.","May 14, 2021",2021

ahhhh ha ha","The Temptations' “Papa Was A Rollin' Stone” was written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong and produced by Whitfield. Released as a single on the Gordy label in late September 1972, the song became an instant smash, and only the veteran group’s third single – after 1964’s “My Girl” and 1971’s “Just My Imagination” – to hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 (though it only reached #5 R&B). The Tempts' version was actually the song’s second single release. Whitfield had initially recorded the song – in a more typical funk arrangement, with lush, almost Latin-inflected instrumentation – on second-tier Motown group The Undisputed Truth, who had a minor hit with it (#24 R&B) earlier in the year. “Papa” was a critical as well as a commercial success, garnering three Grammy Awards in 1973 for the group, the songwriters, and long-time Motown arranger Paul Riser.

At 6:54, “Papa” was easily the longest track Motown had released as a single up to that point, and quite a departure from the company’s “in-and-out-in-under-three-minutes” ethos of the previous decade. The LP version – appearing on the Tempts' album All Directions – is nearly twice as long at over twelve minutes.

With its relatively sparse but expansive instrumentation, the song marks something of a departure from the Sly and the Family Stone-influenced “psychedelic soul” of the early Dennis Edwards era, into the more “orchestral funk” sound that Isaac Hayes and others had made popular through their soundtrack work on so-called blaxploitation films. Like most of the group’s singles since 1968, however, “Papa” finds the Temptations sharing lead vocals. Dennis Edwards, Richard Street, Damon Harris, and Melvin Franklin all snatch a verse of their own, with only founding member and group leader Otis Williams declining to step up to the mic.

shes never hard to find (just my imagination)
shes always on my mind (runnin away with me)","“Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)” was written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong, and produced by Whitfield. It was released as a single on January 14, 1971 and reached #1 on both the pop and R&B charts, making it one of the Temptations' most popular and enduring hits. The song also appeared on the group’s album Sky’s The Limit later that year. While nearly all of the Temptations' singles since 1968 had featured a “psychedelic soul” sound inspired by Sly & The Family Stone, “Just My Imagination” abandons this approach and instead hearkens back to the love ballads that had been the group’s bread and butter in the mid-1960s.

The song was also the last Temptations single to feature longtime members Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams (who sings the line “Every night on my knees I pray”). Both had been with the group from its inception way back in 1957 and before that had even sung in church together as children. Kendricks had never been a fan of the psychedelic soul sound the Temptations adopted in 1968, and after leaving the group he launched a successful solo career singing primarily the kinds of love ballads for which he had previously been known. Williams, sadly, was forced to retire from the group due to personal issues and health problems related to sickle-cell anemia. He committed suicide in 1973.

The Rolling Stones recorded “Just My Imagination” in 1978 for their album Some Girls.

(repeat and fade)","“You Can’t Hurry Love” is a song performed by American female vocal group and Motown Records' most commercially successful act The Supremes. Written and produced by one of Motown’s more accomplished songwriting teams Holland-Dozier-Holland (Brian & Eddie Holland and Lamont Dozier), the song features the silky smooth vocals of Diana Ross on lead and Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson on background vocals, as well as Motown’s session band, The Funk Brothers, helping out on all of the instrumentation. The song was recorded on June 11th and July 5th, 1966, in Hitsville U.S.A. (Studio A). It was released soon after on July 25th, 1966, as the second single from their ninth studio album “The Supremes A' Go-Go” on Motown Records on August 25th that same year, following their first single “Love is Like an Itching in My Heart.” The single was also the A-side to “Put Yourself in My Place,” a track that was actually recorded by four different Motown artists and groups, including The Supremes.

“You Can’t Hurry Love” was released in the middle of the group’s transition from the sounds of their earlier teenage, bubblegum pop phase – which is understandable considering all of their previously released music was recorded when they were in their late teens and early 20s – to more mature themes and musical arrangements.  With this development of their sound came the peak of the group’s success, topping the charts both in the United States and internationally. “You Can’t Hurry Love” was The Supremes' seventh number-one hit single on the Billboard Hot 100, claiming the top spot for two weeks in September 1966. The single also reached number one on the soul chart for two weeks, number one on the U.S. Cash Box Pop Singles chart, peaked at number three on both the Canadian RPM Singles and the U.K. Singles charts, and reached number six on the Australian Singles chart, to name a few. The single also peaked at number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and the U.K. Singles year-end charts. Additionally, the song was permanently inducted into the list of “500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll,” sponsored by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The song was later covered by a number of artists, including the Dixie Chicks on the soundtrack to the 1999 film “Runaway Bride.” However, the most notable cover of “You Can’t Hurry Love” was performed by English vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Phil Collins in November 1982 on his second studio album, “Hello, I Must Be Going!”. Collins' version topped the U.K. Singles charts – a feat not previously achieved by The Supremes and Collins’s first number-one hit in his home country – and peaked at number ten in the U.S. Collins explains that his version of the song was not meant to serve as an interpretation of the original Supremes tune but, rather, as a remake. Many of his musical influences came out of Motown, so his cover was meant to serve as a thankful tribute  to the record company who later influenced his musical stylings. Lamont Dozier, one of the song’s original writers, later commented on Collins’s cover, saying that it was respectful to Motown to keep so many of the original aspects of the song and that his cover was very well done.","August 25, 1966",1966

According to Rolling Stone, Motown label owner Berry Gordy at first thought the song “wasn’t catchy enough”, and sent the group back to the studio, resulting in the catchy “Oooh” at the beginning.

It was their second song that topped the charts, making them the first Motown group that had two #1 songs.

In 2021, the song placed #499 in Rolling Stone’s “500 Best Songs of All Time”.","September 17, 1964",1964

It was written by Lamont Dozier and brothers Brian and Eddie Holland—Motown’s premiere songwriting team. This song marked something of a new start for Holland-Dozier-Holland, as they wanted to try weightier subject matter.
According to Dozier, the song’s one-note guitar part was inspired by Morse Code-style radio news flashes.

Holland-Dozier-Holland got out of Motown’s life in 1967—this was the last of their Supremes hits before leaving the label.

Generations of fans have hung on to this song—it’s returned to the charts on three different occasions. In 1967, psychedelic rockers Vanilla Fudge reached #6 on the Hot 100 with their version.

In 1986, British singer Kim Wilde took the song to back to #1. Wilde’s success made “You Keep Me Hangin’ On” one of the only hits to top the charts by two different artists.

In 1996, country singer Reba McEntire dropped a version that climbed to #2 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.","October 26, 1966",1966

Performed by Thurl Ravenscroft, the song is used as a musical interlude to add emphasis to the Grinch’s nastiness and sick nature.

Despite his performance, Thurl was not credited for the song on the special, leading many to believe that the narrator and voice of the Grinch for the special, Boris Karloff, performed the song as well. Rumors also floated around that Tennessee Ernie Ford was responsible for the song.","December 18, 1966",1966

Written by Smokey Robinson, it was first recorded by The Miracles in 1960. Since then, it has been covered by various artists including The Temptations and The Supremes.



Released as the B-Side to I Want You Back, in 1969, the Jackson 5 cover is the most famous version.  It’s notable for young Michael’s outstanding vocal performance.

The Jackson 5 performed this song on their first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show.

During live performances, Michael usually provided an intro about how he met a girl at school during sandbox. They  shared cookies and then had an unfortunate falling out during finger painting. The segment typically ended with “I stepped up to her and I said…”  leading into the song’s opening line.","December 18, 1969",1969

The song became a number-one dance hit, topping Billboard’s Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart first for 3 weeks in August of 1980 and again for two weeks the following month. It also peaked at #5  on the Billboard Hot 100 and #6 on Billboard’s R&B chart. “I’m Coming Out” also performed well overseas.



The track is also well-known for being sampled in The Notorious B.I.G.’s 1997 chart-topper “Mo' Money Mo' Problems”.","August 22, 1980",1980

He finds himself so due to his girlfriend dumping him or ‘turning him wrong’ in some other way which caused the dissolution of their relationship.  This song peaked at number 2 on Billboard’s Hot Black Singles (i.e. Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs) and number 31 on the Hot 100.,"May 17, 1982",1982

last night i dreamed
that you were here with me
and we were in each others arms it was oh so heavenly
you held me close to you and whispered in my ear
""lets build a life together share love beyond compare""

as we danced to the melody
we had so much to share (then the music stopped)
in a flash i was all alone (it was just a dream)
haunting me once again

a dream a simple fantasy
that i wished was reality
that youd come knocking at my door
and wed relive this dream once more

the day you left you said you would return
just when you wouldnt promise said you needed time alone
you said you loved me and someday our love could be
i couldnt understand it i thought we were both happy

as we danced to the melody
we had so much to share (then the music stopped)
in a flash i was all alone (it was just a dream)
haunting me once again
a dream a simple fantasy
(a simple fantasy that i)
that i wished was reality (oh oh that you ooh)
that youd come knocking at my door
(and wed) and wed relive this dream once more
(oh oh oh a dream baby)
a dream a simple fantasy
(its just a fantasy that i)
that i wished was reality
(that youd come knocking at my door)
come knocking at my door
(oh and wed) and wed relive this dream once more
a dream

hold me love me with all your heart
oh oh come back
please make my dream come true for me
i need so much for you to see
i need you to love me once again
oh oh oh oh baby

a dream a simple fantasy
(oh)
that i wished was reality
(i understand its a fantasy but you)
that youd come knocking at my door
(come knocking at my door)

a dream a simple fantasy
(a dream a simple fantasy that i wished was reality oh baby)
that i wished was reality
(oh baby oh)
that youd come knocking at my door
and wed relive this dream once more","The sample used in “I Ain’t Mad At Cha” by 2Pac may be what most recognize about this song today, but it’s a unique song in its own right.

As one of the only DeBarge songs where Bunny takes lead vocals, it’s presumably from a woman’s point of view. Further, it’s one of the more tragic songs in the DeBarge catalogue as the narrator’s hope of reuniting with a former partner is granted each night in a recurring dream. However, each morning she’s jolted into reality only to once again realize that she’s alone in the world and has no one to love or love her. The tragedy is that she may be able to move on to another relationship, but each night the dream retards her progress.","September 24, 1983",1983

Released in 1994 as the lead single from Mariah Carey’s first holiday album and fourth studio album, Merry Christmas, the song has become established as a Christmas standard. It has sold more than 14 million copies globally since its debut, making it one of the best-selling singles ever. In the US, the song has sold 3.6 million downloads as of 2019.

Over time, countless artists have covered the song, including Miley Cyrus, John Mayer, Shania Twain, Ariana Grande, Fifth Harmony, Demi Lovato, Cee Lo Green, Lady Antebellum and Mumford & Sons.

Mariah herself has re-recorded the song too. In 2011, Carey re-recorded the song as a duet with Justin Bieber. A year later in 2012, Carey recorded a fun version with classroom instruments and children for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

The song’s influence has extended beyond music, too. In 2015, Carey released a book with the same title as her holiday staple, acknowledging the song’s longevity:

When I wrote ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ it was my dream for it to become a classic Christmas song. I am so proud of the song’s impact as it continues to create memories for fans each year. I am thrilled to be able to bring the story of the song to new generations of families with the picture book.

She also released a movie called Mariah Carey’s All I Want For Christmas Is You in 2017.

The song’s legacy remains unparalleled. It charts every holiday season since its original release, and is estimated to have earned Carey $60 million in royalties. The song is also referred to as “the biggest Christmas song of all time”. The song’s immense popularity has earned Mariah the title ‘Queen of Christmas’, a title she isn’t exactly sure about:

I don’t accept that name because I feel like it’s [too much]. I humbly thank them and I do have an extraordinary love for the holiday season, and it is the best time of the year.

After 25 years, the track finally reached No. 1 in Billboard Hot 100, becoming Mariah’s 19th song to do so and making the singer the solo artist with most Billboard Hot 100 chart-toppers. It also sets a new record of the longest run to No. 1 on the chart, surpassing Elton John’s re-recording of “Candle in the Wind.”","November 1, 1994",1994

The track was #1 on the Billboard charts for 14 weeks, which is the second-longest running #1 song in US chart history, behind Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men’s “One Sweet Day” (16 weeks).

The video clip shows Mariah Carey during a wedding with a young man played by Prison Break star Wentworth Miller.","March 29, 2005",2005

After that, Cannon continued the beef by releasing a diss track, as also challenging the rapper to a boxing match that never actually happened.

It is no strange that the Detroit MC has referenced the New York native superstar multiple times, starting from The Eminem Show cuts like “Superman” and “When The Music Stops” along with the December 2006 track “Jimmy Crack Corn”.
Carey’s “Clown” was the official response to the 2002 subliminals.

Over a decade later, “Obsessed” has saw a renewed interest thanks to a viral TikTok meme of a 13-year old Reese Hardy dancing to the song while sobbing. The singer herself also joined the challenge, when her private car broke down on the way to the Fresh Air Fund-operated Camp Mariah, which she started back in the mid-90’s.

The song was written and produced by Carey, Miguel, Nathan Perez, Mac Robinson, Brooke Davis and Brian Keith Warfield.

Mariah told Ryan Seacrest about wanting to work with Miguel on the song – “I’m a huge fan of his music and as I think everybody’s so blown away by him right now.” Alternatively, Miguel has stated that he has loved Mariah ever since she “walked out of the pool in that ‘Honey’ video”.

#Beautiful received positive critical reactions, many of whom praised the idea of a duet between Carey and Miguel. Some even referred to the song as 2013’s ‘song of the summer’.

The song has 5 remix editions, featuring verses from A$AP Rocky to Young Jeezy. Many of these mixes are dance/club remixes. A sixth remix is known to exist, though it was never released by Carey. It is also known to be another dance mix, however.","May 6, 2013",2013

Frank tries to act tough when reflecting back on a past relationship, but ultimately reveals he still has strong feelings for his ex-lover, and wonders if they have been able to move on or feel the same way he does.

The track was performed on Saturday Night Live, and was also nominated for record of the year in the 2012 Grammys.

It also touches upon the events Frank faced while living in Houston after relocating from New Orleans due to Hurricane Katrina. The song’s title is taken from the hook, in which Ocean raps about living a life connected by rough nights.

The song’s structure is divided into two main sides; the first part is rap-heavy, accompanied by pitched up guitar riffs to provide the melody. In the second part the music turns somber and slow, serving as a parallel to a crash after a drug high.

The change in tempo is used to signify the halfway point of the album, playing further into the idea of duality established throughout the album.","August 20, 2016",2016

The intro features a high-pitch vocal effect Frank uses throughout the album. The squeaky voice suggests Frank is reminiscing about events that happened in his youth.

Austin Feinstein of indie band Slow Hollows and Yung Lean sing the choruses. Austin sings the first alone, with Yung Lean joining him on the second.","August 20, 2016",2016

It might have been done merely for shock value, or because Reed liked gritty subjects, or as a dark poem of addiction; the beauty of this song is that it works on all of these levels, and many more, at the same time. In many of his songs, we have cases where Lou Reed kept the focus on providing an objective description of the topic without taking a moral stance on thematter.

(From Songfacts)

The desire for something you can’t describe… This is about a guy who is jumping towards God or the perfection of Jesus. There’s a ferocious desire within the song to solve a problem. He doesn’t have much left apart from a desire to score; spiritually he’s bereft, but he thinks if he can get his fix, life will become better. I don’t know if it’s about a specific person, more likely an amalgamation, but it’s a beautiful portrayal of someone at their wits’ end.

sunday morning","“Sunday Morning” is the opening song to The Velvet Underground’s debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico. The song describes the feeling of staying up all Saturday night into Sunday morning. Aptly, Reed & Cale wrote the song after one of those nights at 6 AM on a Sunday morning. As Cale remembered in a 2006 interview with Uncut:

Lou and I had been up all night on crank, as usual, so we decided to visit one of his old Syracuse college pals. Unfortunately, this guy’s upper-middle-class wife didn’t appreciate visits from old college pals high on amphetamines, at 3am, who wanted to play music. He had a guitar which Lou picked up and the evening inspired him to write the song.

The most polished song on the album, “Sunday Morning” was released as a single in December 1966. MGM/Verve spent little, if any effort to promote it and it sunk, unnoticed, on release. However, it grew in popularity through radio play by DJs like John Peel and Dick Summer, sowing the seeds for the Velvets' cult following.

The band made a live version of the song for their last concert with Lou, on the album Live at Max’s Kansas City, where Reed introduces the song with: “This is a song about when you’ve done something so sad and you wake up the next day and you remember it. Not to sound grim or anything… just, once in a while, you have one of those days.”
This can bring another meaning to the song. A song of regret and, maybe, of a new dawn that would represent forgiveness (“[…]always some around you who will call. It’s nothing at all”).","March 12, 1967",1967

The song and its topic challenged songwriting conventions at the time, the celebration of sexual masochism out in the open wasn’t something you heard every day. The word “masochism”, coined by 19th century sexologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing, also comes from Sacher-Masoch’s name, so dude wasn’t kidding around.","March 12, 1967",1967

","‘Major Tom’ is a fictional character created by David Bowie for this song in 1969. That same year marked the first moon landing, so space was “in”; this was a year after Stanley Kubrick’s film 2001: A Space Odyssey, co-written with Arthur C. Clarke.

The song is a “lost in space” story, which generated later more songs and sequels about the character by David Bowie (“Ashes to Ashes” and “Hallo Spaceboy”) and even other artists (Peter Schilling’s 1983 “Major Tom (coming home)”, (K.I.A.’s “Mrs Major Tom” and possibly Elton John’s “Rocket Man”. The last one is also produced by Gus Dudgeon, who filled in for Bowie’s usual collaborator Tony Visconti once he refused to work in “Space Oddity” feeling it was a novelty song, a publicity stunt to cash in to the Apollo missions (“this is not ‘Space Oddity’, it’s Ernie The Milkman”).

Many believe that the song describes a drug (heroin) trip, from “lift-off” to “floating” to being “still” with “circuit’s dead” ending in “nothing I can do”.","July 11, 1969",1969

ohohohoh ohohohoh just for one day","During his Berlin Period, Bowie spied Tony Visconti kissing backing vocalist Antonia Maaß by the Berlin Wall. Their love was doomed, as Visconti was married.

I thought, of all the places to meet in Berlin, why pick a bench underneath a guard turret on the Wall?

https://youtu.be/VudyGkGWDlc?t=179

Wanting to stop his friend’s affair from coming to his wife’s attention, Bowie anonymised the song, and filled in details from his imagination. As Rolling Stone put it, “Bowie wails with crazed soul about two doomed lovers finding a moment of redemption together — just for one day.”

The song was written with Brian Eno, who plays a droning EMS VCS3. Robert Fripp of King Crimson plays guitar with pitched feedback, whilst Tony Visconti produced Bowie’s finest vocal performance by moving the microphone away from him as the song progressed, forcing him to shout just to be heard.

The song was not initially popular, but is now widely considered one of Bowie’s best. It is frequently played at sporting events and awards ceremonies, and features in many soundtracks in film and television.

It’s believed the track was inspired by German band Neu! whom Bowie was a fan of at the time. Neu! guitarist Michael Rother had been in conversation with Bowie a few times during Bowie’s time in Berlin and they had discussed the possibility of Rother playing on the album, but it didn’t happen due to a miscommunication.","September 23, 1977",1977

","“★” (pronounced “Blackstar”) is perhaps Bowie’s most experimental work since 1977’s Low. It contains several total shifts in instrumentation, but whilst images of death crop up repeatedly, the lyrics are abstruse and there are no obvious clues to any story unifying the fragments.

It is the titular first single from Bowie’s 27th  and final studio album, released on the 8th of January 2016. Bowie tragically died only two days later.  Unbeknownst to the world, he had been struggling with liver cancer for 18 months.

The song was originally conceived when Johan Renck asked Bowie to compose the theme music for The Last Panthers, a crime show he was directing. An edited version of the song was released for that purpose, before the single version was officially released in full on the 20th of November 2015. It was accompanied by a music video, full of bizarre imagery, directed by Renck.","November 8, 2015",2015

","“Baba O'Riley” by The Who was initially part of an idea (later thrown aside) of a follow up rock opera to Tommy: Lifehouse. Pete Townshend wrote it after his experience at Woodstock.

It did well as a single in Europe, but appeared only on the album in the US and the UK.

The name of the song is a combination of Meher Baba – an Indian guru who kept silent from 1935 until his death in 1969 and inspired Townshend spiritually, and Terry Riley – a musician and classical composer who also inspired him.

Mistakenly called sometimes “Teenage Wasteland” due to the repeating phrase.

It began with a very long meeting dealing with royalties for his songs: “Eleven hours in the Tin Pan, God, there’s got to be another way.” The “Tin Pan” he is referring to is “Tin Pan Alley” which is the name given to the collection of New York City-centered music publishers and songwriters who dominated the popular music of the United States. After this excruciating meeting he received a large check for royalties, left and went to a bar and got completely drunk. In that bar he encountered Paul Cook and Steve Jones of The Sex Pistols, who thought very highly of Pete for paving the way for Punk rock music. Townshend was conflicted because he feared The Who had sold out, and seeing The Sex Pistols, who were icons of rebellion, exasperated him even more. Pete left that bar and passed out in a random doorway in Soho (a part of New York). A policeman recognized him (“A policeman knew my name”) and being kind, woke him and and told him, “You can go sleep at home tonight (instead of a jail cell), if you can get up and walk away.” Pete’s response: “Who the f–k are you?”

The song would have a popularity resurgence once it became the CSI opening theme.

there is a light and it never goes out","The Smiths' classic “There Is a Light That Never Goes Out” is a sacred song by now, one that makes fans across the globe join hands and mope together.

The song was the second single off of The Smiths' 1986 The Queen Is Dead album (although released as a single six years after the album was released).

The song became The Smiths' second song to top BBC Radio One DJ John Peel’s Festive Fifty poll in his 1986 edition.
As a single, the song reached number 25 on the UK Singles Chart.

The song has been referenced in multiple works of art, such as the novel Trainspotting, the movie (500) Days of Summer and the TV series Orange is the New Black. Multiple artists have also covered it, including superfan Noel Gallagher and Miley Cyrus.

The fan favorite has stood out for its ideal balance of Morrissey’s irreplaceable voice and lyricism and the ingenious guitar ability of Johnny Marr.","June 16, 1986",1986

This song was covered by Death Cab For Cutie.","October 31, 1983",1983

It’s most people’s favourite, I think.” Despite its prominent place in The Smiths' repertoire, however, it is not generally considered to be representative of the band’s style.

Although a club favourite, “How Soon Is Now?” did not chart as well as writers Morrissey and Marr had expected. Most commentators put this down to the fact that the song had been out on vinyl in a number of forms before being released as a single in its own right. The original track runs for nearly seven minutes; however, the 7"" single edit cut the length down to under four minutes. The complete version is generally used on compilations. The song has been widely praised for the artistry of its lyrics.

The heavily-reverbed riff that propels the song is a wonderfully repurposed version of Bo Diddley’s “Who Do You Love.”","January 28, 1985",1985

A loud, upbeat song about the famous French short film Un Chien Andalou, “Debaser” features many of the band’s signature musical motifs: a loud, distorted cacophony of guitars, bouncy bass line, cryptic lyrics and Black Francis' classic half-screaming delivery.



However, unlike most of its peers on the album, “Debaser” eschews the band’s habitual use of dynamics (sharp transitions from soft to loud) in favor of a more consistent volume.","April 18, 1989",1989

Black Francis told Esquire

This belongs in the mythological category. I’m less concerned with making sense than making the lyrics pop out of the speaker when people are listening to the music. Some of it is obvious enough to understand, but then ‘If man is five, the devil is six, then God is seven,’ and guess what? That rhymes with ‘Monkey gone to heaven,’ and it’s all a little bit of a mixture of saying things that are real and relevant with a lot of Alice in Wonderland jibber-jabber and gobbledygook.

The single was released on September 7 1994, on what would have been Buddy Holly’s 58th birthday. The song was an international hit, reaching #17 on the US pop charts, and #12 in the UK.

In 2011, Rolling Stone named “Buddy Holly” one of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Despite its popular and critical success, songwriter Rivers Cuomo had little confidence in the song, and had to be prodded by producer Ric Ocasek to include it on the album.

 Bassist Matt Sharp described how hard Ric pushed for the song:

Ric said we’d be stupid to leave it off the album. We’d come into the studio in the morning and find little pieces of paper with doodles on them: “WE WANT BUDDY HOLLY!”

The groundbreaking music video for “Buddy Holly” was filmed by Spike Jonze, later famous for  directing films such as Being John Malkovich and Her.  Jonze digitally inserted the band playing at “Arnold’s” diner from the television show Happy Days, interspersed with footage from the show.

In 2007, Rivers Cuomo released a demo of the song as a part of his solo album Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo.","September 7, 1994",1994

In 2013, Rolling Stone rated the song the 46th best summer song of all time. The song was also featured in a 2006 episode of The Simpsons entitled “The Wettest Stories Ever Told”.

","“Undone – The Sweater Song” was Weezer’s first single off their self-titled 1994 debut album.

Frontman Rivers Cuomo has commented on the song to Rolling Stone:

“‘The Sweater Song’ was the first Weezer song I ever wrote, back in 1991,” Cuomo says. “I was trying to write a Velvet Underground-type song because I was super into them, and I came up with that guitar riff. I just picked up that acoustic guitar and the first thing I played was that riff. And it just feels so classic to me, even now when the band starts to play it, it just takes over the energy in the room and you’re just transported into the world of Weezer. It wasn’t until years after I wrote it that I realized it’s almost a complete rip-off of ‘Sanitarium’ by Metallica. It just perfectly encapsulates Weezer to me – you’re trying to be cool like Velvet Underground but your metal roots just pump through unconsciously.

Cuomo has also said {citation needed}:

“Undone” is the feeling you get when the train stops and the little guy comes knockin' on your door. It was supposed to be a sad song, but everyone thinks it’s hilarious.","June 24, 1994",1994

","The Cranberries describe the violence in “The Troubles,” the decades-long conflict in Northern Ireland between nationalists (mainly self-identified as Irish or Roman Catholic) and unionists (mainly self-identified as British or Protestant).

Dolores O'Riordan wrote the song during the band’s English tour in 1993 in memory of two young boys, Tim Parry and Johnathan Ball, who were killed in an IRA bombing in Warrington, England.

“This song is our cry against man’s inhumanity to man, inhumanity to child,” she said.

During a performance of “Zombie” in January 1994 at The Astoria in London, Dolores O'Riordan said:

This song is our cry against the violence in London, against the war in the north of Ireland. And we want it to stop.","September 14, 1994",1994

Despite being on the original demo that got them signed in 1990, their record label chose to hold off on releasing “Linger” as a single until 1993, after both a 1991 EP and a their debut single “Dreams” in 1992 had come out. However, it wasn’t until MTV added the video into rotation in late 1993 while they were touring with Suede (Known as London Suede in the US) that it was reissued and became a top 40 hit in five countries, launching the band into international stardom in 1994. It remains the Cranberries only top 10 hit and only gold selling single in the US.

Dolores O'Riordan has said that the song was written about her first boyfriend and “being broken-hearted by a love situation. You love somebody but they reject you”. The music was written before she joined the band, and her lyrics replaced the pre-existing ones written by the group’s previous vocalist.","February 23, 1993",1993

So, “Dreams” was then reissued and found chart success.

im going back to 505
if its a sevenhour flight or a fortyfiveminute drive
in my imagination youre waiting lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs

stop and wait a sec
when you look at me like that my darling what did you expect
id probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
or i did last time i checked

not shy of a spark
the knife twists at the thought that i should fall short of the mark
frightened by the bite though its no harsher than the bark
the middle of adventure such a perfect place to start

im going back to 505
if its a sevenhour flight or a fortyfiveminute drive
in my imagination youre waiting lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs

but i crumble completely when you cry
it seems like once again youve had to greet me with ""goodbye""
im always just about to go and spoil the surprise
take my hands off of your eyes too soon

im going back to 505
if its a sevenhour flight or a fortyfive minute drive
in my imagination youre waiting lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs and a smile","“505” is one of the songs that marks a turning point in Alex Turner’s songwriting, as he discovers new emotional depths.

The organ chords are the same as were used in Ennio Morricone’s soundtrack for the iconic Western, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, where Angel Eyes enters before the final standoff.

The title could be an allusion to “Flight 505” by The Rolling Stones, with both songs sharing the theme of going somewhere to recapture a feeling or moment… or a person.","April 18, 2007",2007

now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everythings in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though

remember when you used to be a rascal

the best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
werent as daft as they seem arent as daft as they seem
my love when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric
now when shes told shes gonna get it
im guessing that shed rather just forget it
clinging till im getting sentimental
said she wasnt going but she went still
likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
was it a mecca dauber or a betting pencil

werent as daft as they seem not as daft as they seem

(oh)","“Fluorescent Adolescent” is a ballad about getting older and finding out that life isn’t as fun anymore. It describes a woman who dreams of her youth while her current life is unsatisfying and boring, with emphasis on her sex life.

The song is one of the band’s most popular and a concert staple.

The writing of this is co-credited to Johanna Bennett, Alex Turner’s ex-girlfriend. The song’s roots lie in a Mediterranean holiday Turner and Bennett took during which they were reminiscing about characters they knew at school, as he recalled in The Times magazine in 2007 (documented by NME magazine):

It started off as a joke. Then it were like, “Here’s another verse.” We were having a laugh. Some of the lines were hers. I couldn’t have not credited her. It’s just right, really.

As documented by NME magazine, Johanna herself said during an interview for The Observer that:


We were on holiday and had cut ourselves off from everything. We were in a really quiet hotel and didn’t watch TV or listen to that much music… So as not to drive each other mad we started messing around with these words like game, singing them to each other.

It’s great to think that it came from something we did for fun on holiday. It’ll always be a good memory for Alex and I. He doesn’t usually write lyrics with other people, though I think he enjoyed it.","July 4, 2007",2007

one of a classic style of love poem, love song, in which the writer expresses his desire to be useful to the object of his desire.

The beat is strongly reminiscent of “Spanish Sahara.”
Reworking a poem into a song is extremely difficult and as John Cooper Clarke put it Alex has changed a semi-comedic poem into a full-on love song. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jkiz8R1VyI","September 6, 2013",2013

During a 2011 Rolling Stone interview, Foster said:

I was trying to get inside the head of an isolated, psychotic kid.

Although this song is peppy and upbeat, Foster uses this to mask the true meaning of the song, and makes for a beautiful yet haunting composition, a tension which he referenced in the same interview:

It’s a ‘fuck you’ song to the hipsters in a way – but it’s a song the hipsters are going to want to dance to.

Despite many believing that this song condones and encourages violence, Foster said otherwise in a 2011 USA Today interview:

The song is not about condoning violence at all. It’s the complete opposite. The song is an amazing platform to have a conversation with your kids about something that shouldn’t be ignored, to talk about it in a loving way.","October 14, 2010",2010

First, it is a notable example of early metal, known in retrospect as “stoner metal” due to its psychedelic traits. Other “stoner” bands include Iron Butterfly and Black Sabbath.

Second, instead of the response lyrics of the Cochrane and Who versions, this version features “mini solos” performed by each member of the band.

In the 1991 film Night on Earth, a young Winona Ryder appears as a taxi driver during the Los Angeles vignette. Among the things she does while driving is play loud music, with the Blue Cheer version of Summertime Blues being one of the songs.",1968,1968

The lyrics were written by and about bassist Geezer Butler, whom the band often called paranoid, even though he didn’t know what the word meant. They are about Butler’s feelings as a depressed teenager and him thinking he was going insane.

According to the band, the song only took 20 minutes to write. It was supposed to be just a filler song and the album was supposed to be called War Pigs. When they released it as a single and it got very popular, however, the record label wanted them to name the album Paranoid.","September 18, 1970",1970

","The guitar riff on this song is considered one of the most famous in rock history, and it is what the entire song was written around. And no, it’s not related to the Marvel character, who was created eight years earlier in 1963.

Via Time:

The alarming, dissonant guitar groan that kicks off “Iron Man,” eventually cohering into a primal five-note riff, struck lead singer Ozzy Osbourne as evoking “a big iron bloke walking about.”","September 18, 1970",1970

","As the opening track of the influential Black Sabbath album, Paranoid, “War Pigs” was originally titled “Walpurgis.” Walpurgis Night takes place on the 30th April to mark the eve of the feast day of Saint Walpurga, an 8th-century English missionary to the Frankish Empire. It is also believed to be the night of a witches’ meeting or sabbath. The instrumental outro is entitled, “Luke’s Wall.”

The song talks about war and—like the hippies—Black Sabbath was totally against it, specifically the Vietnam War (occurring at the time), and although Geezer Butler has stated that:

[“War Pigs” is] totally against the Vietnam War, about how these rich politicians and rich people start all the wars for their benefit and get all the poor people to die for them.

And in an interview with Mojo in 2017:

Britain was on the verge of being brought into it, there was protests in the street, all kinds of anti-Vietnam things going on. War is the real Satanism. Politicians are the real Satanists. That’s what I was trying to say.

Ozzy Osbourne has said that:

[The group] knew nothing about Vietnam. It’s just an anti-war song.","September 18, 1970",1970

Butler later referred to it as

just a humorous take on Satan falling in love.

Ozzy and Iommi also stated that

the title has nothing to do with the content of the song.

The famous bass solo by Geezer Butler at the beginning of the song is named “Bassically.”","February 13, 1970",1970

theres a lady whos sure all that glitters is gold
and shes buying a stairway to heaven
when she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
with a word she can get what she came for
ooh ooh and shes buying a stairway to heaven
theres a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
in a tree by the brook theres a songbird who sings
sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

ooh it  makes me wonder
ooh makes me wonder

theres a feeling i get when i look to the west
and my spirit is crying for leaving
in my thoughts i have seen rings of smoke through the trees
and the voices of those who stand looking

ooh it makes me wonder
ooh really makes me wonder
and its whispered that soon if we all call the tune
then the piper will lead us to reason
and a new day will dawn for those who stand long
and the forests will echo with laughter

ohohohohwoahhh

if theres a bustle in your hedgerow dont be alarmed now
its just a spring clean for the may queen
yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run
theres still time to change the road youre on

and it makes me wonder
ohh woah

your head is humming and it wont go in case you dont know
the pipers calling you to join him
dear lady can you hear the wind blow and did you know
your stairway lies on the whispering wind

and as we wind on down the road
our shadows taller than our soul
there walks a lady we all know
who shines white light and wants to show
how everything still turns to gold
and if you listen very hard
the tune will come to you at last
when all are one and one is all
to be a rock and not to roll

and shes buying a stairway to heaven","“Stairway to Heaven” is one of Led Zeppelin’s most famous recordings, with many considering it the greatest rock song of all time. It tells the story of a greedy woman who is overly optimistic about her unpromising future.

The song resonated with young listeners, opening up a door to a different realm of spirituality and transporting them into a more mystical view of life. The vagueness of the lyrics also allows listeners to interpret the song in their own way, adding to the magic and mystery of the track.","November 8, 1971",1971

The lyrics, as explained by Robert Plant and documented by Wikipedia, are influenced by the band visiting Iceland, a land first settled by Vikings:

We weren’t being pompous (about the song)… We did come from the land of the ice and snow. We were guests of the Icelandic Government on a cultural mission. We were invited to play a concert in Reykjavik and the day before we arrived all the civil servants went on strike and the gig was going to be cancelled. The university prepared a concert hall for us and it was phenomenal. The response from the kids was remarkable and we had a great time. ‘Immigrant Song’ was about that trip and it was the opening track on the album that was intended to be incredibly different.","October 5, 1970",1970

The whole inspiration came from the fact that the road went on and on and on. It was a single-track road which neatly cut through the desert. Two miles to the East and West were ridges of sandrock. It basically looked like you were driving down a channel, this dilapidated road, and there was seemingly no end to it.

“Kashmir” is both a fan favorite and a live staple that was played at nearly every concert after its release. It features one of the most memorable LZ riffs.","February 24, 1975",1975

","The song was written by Paul Stanley and Bob Ezrin and is about a real Kiss fan who was killed in a car accident on his way to a Kiss concert.

Song information:
The song, recorded and released as a single in 1976, was the third single from Kiss’s album Destroyer and was planned to be their last in support of the album. As a single, it did poorly in sales and radio play (other than in Detroit), and failed to chart in the U.S. even though it would prove to be a fan favorite. It came as a surprise that the B-side “Beth”, a ballad written and sung by drummer Peter Criss, wound up catching on in different markets in the United States, so the single was reissued with “Beth” as the A-side and “Detroit Rock City” as the B-side.

During the Love Gun/Alive II tour, Stanley changed the lyric, “I know I’m gonna die, why?” to “I know I’m gonna die, and I don’t care!” The song was #6 on VH1’s 40 Greatest Metal Songs and is featured on the album Heavy Metal – The First 20 Years. “Detroit Rock City” was based on an earlier song that Kiss performed only in concert called “Acrobat”.

The radio voice over at the start if the song is actually Gene Simmons.

Personnel:
Paul Stanley – lead vocals/rhythm guitar/backing vocals.
Ace Frehley – lead guitar.
Gene Simmons – bass guitar/backing vocals.
Peter Criss – drums.","July 28, 1976",1976

for the devil sends the beast with wrath
because he knows the time is short
let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
for it is a human number
its number is six hundred and sixtysix

i left alone my mind was blank
i needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
what did i see can i believe
that what i saw that night was real and not just fantasy
just what i saw in my old dreams
were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me
cos in my dreams its always there
the evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
yeah

night was black was no use holding back
cos i just had to see was someone watching me
in the mist dark figures move and twist
was all this for real or just some kind of hell

sixsixsix the number of the beast
hell and fire was spawned to be released
torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
as they start to cry hands held to the sky
in the night the fires are burning bright
the ritual has begun satans work is done

sixsixsix the number of the beast
sacrifice is going on tonight

this cant go on i must inform the law
can this still be real or just some crazy dream
but i feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
seem to mesmerize cant avoid the eyes

sixsixsix the number of the beast
sixsixsix the one for you and me

im coming back i will return
and ill possess your body and ill make you burn
i have the fire i have the force
i have the power to make my evil take its course","This song was the band’s second single from their 1982 album. It was influenced by the 1978 horror movie Damien: Omen II, which is about the 13-year-old Antichrist. It is one of Iron Maiden’s most famous and one of heavy metal’s most recognizable songs.

Basically, this song is about a dream. It’s not about devil worship.

—Steve Harris

The song starts with a quote from the Bible, read by British actor Barry Clayton; the first lines from Revelations 12:12 and the last three from Revelations 13:8. The band wanted the horror film actor Vincent Price to read this intro, but he wanted more money than they were willing to pay.

During the recording of the album, there were rumors floating about that supernatural occurrences had been going on in the studio, such as lights flipping on and off, strange noises and visions of Satan, that culminated in a car accident their producer Martin Birch was involved, the bill of which was 666 GBP. This was used as evidence that Satan and the Antichrist had a hand in making this. Many preachers and enemies of rock music were led to believe Maiden were Satanists because of the song’s title. Steve Harris replied: “They completely got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn’t read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists.”

Bruce Dickinson’s high-pitched scream at the end of the intro was a result of producer Martin Birch forcing the band to replay the intro several times. Dickinson became so fed up with the constant repeats that he emitted the scream out of frustration, and it fit so well that the band decided to keep it.","March 22, 1982",1982

and when im walking a dark road

when the light begins to change

a little anxious when its dark

i have a constant fear
that somethings always near
fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someones always there

have you run your fingers down the wall
and have you felt your neck skin crawl
when youre searching for the light

i have constant fear
that somethings always near

you find it hard to look again
because youre sure theres someone there

when im walking a dark road
i am a man who walks alone","The title track from Iron Maiden’s last album with lead singer Bruce Dickinson before his seven-year departure from the band, “Fear of the Dark” can be straightforwardly interpreted as a song about nyctophobia, and by extension whatever hides in darkness. The dark can also be more broadly interpreted as anything unknown or unfamiliar to someone that inspires in them fear and anxiety.

Steve [Harris], who wrote it, is really afraid of the dark. It’s the story of a man who walks in a park at night and, as it’s getting darker, he sees all sorts of worrying things. He becomes totally paranoid ‘cause his imagination is working overtime. It’s a great track.

—Bruce Dickinson



The song also sees more crowd participation than most other Iron Maiden songs. During live concerts, fans and spectators will often sing along to the guitar intro as well as the instrumental interlude.","May 11, 1992",1992

as i plunge on into certain death

the mighty roar of the russian guns
and as we race towards the human wall
the screams of pain as my comrades fall

and the russians fire another round

we wont live to fight another day

we get so close near enough to fight

and as i lay there gazing at the sky
my bodys numb and my throat is dry
and as i lay forgotten and alone
without a tear i draw my parting groan

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh","“The Trooper” tells of the futile heroism of a British soldier during the Charge of the Light Brigade, a light infantry manoeuvre during the Battle of Balaclava (1854) that was famously retold in Tennyson’s poem.

The poem was written 6 weeks after the event, reaching the British troops still fighting in the Crimean War (1853-1856), where it became an inspiring tribute.

The song was the second single released from Piece of Mind, and at the time was famous for its MTV banned music video, which depicted scenes from the 1936 Errol Flynn movie, in which actual horses died.

The song itself has since inspired Iron Maiden’s own beer:



And the Eddie from the single cover is even stamped on the arm of the song’s composer, Steve Harris.","May 16, 1983",1983

cos at five oclock they take me to the gallows pole

running low yeah

when the priest comes to read me the last rites
take a look through the bars at the last sights
of a world that has gone very wrong for me
can it be that theres some sort of error
hard to stop the surmounting terror
is it really the end not some crazy dream

somebody please tell me that im dreaming
its not easy to stop from screaming
but words escape me when i try to speak
tears fall but why am i crying
after all im not afraid of dying
dont i believe that there never is an end


as the guards march me out to the courtyard
somebody cries from a cell ""god be with you""
if theres a god why has he let me go
as i walk my life drifts before me
and though the end is near im not sorry
catch my soul its willing to fly away
mark my words believe my soul lives on
dont worry now that i have gone
ive gone beyond to seek the truth
when you know that your time is close at hand
maybe then youll begin to understand
life down here is just a strange illusion

The listener is given no context regarding the prisoner’s crime (could he be the narrator from several of the tracks on Killers?), but is instead treated to an introspective look at the meaning of life.

The title of the song, “Hallowed Be Thy Name,” comes from The Lord’s Prayer (exact text of the prayer varies by denomination).

Our Father, who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,
On Earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation
And deliver us from evil



The prisoner initially confronts his fear and dread at the prospect of his death by hanging, but remembers his beliefs. At first he scorns the idea of God, then he takes comfort in the idea of a higher power taking him in upon death, and ends up with a realization that life on Earth isn’t really important.

Several of this song’s lines were lifted from British prog band Beckett’s 1974 track “Life’s Shadow” by Steve Harris. The Iron Maiden bassist saw Beckett perform in 1973 and their debut LP was one of his favorite albums when it was first released. He initially used the lyrics as a placeholder and did not have time to change them before Number of the Beast was released.
After Beckett’s retired band manager Barry McKay filed a lawsuit, £100,000 (approximately $138,000) was paid by Iron Maiden out of court to “Life’s Shadow” songwriters Brian Quinn and Robert Barton.

This song quickly became one of Iron Maiden’s most acclaimed works, with several bands recording covers of it. This song may have helped inspire Metallica’s similarly themed Ride The Lightning.","March 22, 1982",1982

","On their controversial self-titled album which came to be known as the Black Album, “Nothing Else Matters” was perhaps the greatest example of the new Metallica sound that alienated core fans. Frontman James Hetfield had been taking classical guitar lessons and wanted to show off his fingerpicking skills in the introduction. The song grew out of an extension of a phone call James made with his girlfriend while on tour and he was picking his guitar while on the phone.

While the song does get heavy during the second guitar solo, it is for the most part, a ballad about expressing your feelings, like an Emerson poem:

It was a song for myself in my room on tour when I was bumming out about being away from home. It’s quite amazing, it’s a true testament to honesty and exposing yourself, putting your real self out there, and taking the risk, taking a gamble that someone’s either going to step on your heart with spikes on or they’re going to put their heart right next to it, and you never know until you try. That solidified, I think, that we were doing the right thing, writing from the heart about what we felt, and you can’t go wrong that way.

“Nothing Else Matters” has become a song that any complete beginner who has never picked up a guitar can feel like they are playing Metallica for a few measures.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAGnKpE4NCI

Famed Hollywood composer Michael Kamen contributed an orchestrated part, which was mixed somewhat low in the song. To compensate, years later Metallica did the S&M concert and album with Kamen conducting the San Francisco Symphony, with “Nothing Else Matters” being a centerpiece and single.","August 12, 1991",1991

taken my soul left me with life in hell
","The fourth track on Metallica’s classic, …And Justice for All, is based on the novel Johnny Got His Gun by Dalton Trumbo. There, Joe Bonham, a soldier in World War I, is hit by a landmine explosion that takes away his limbs and face, and becomes a prisoner in his own body – Joe lost his senses and can’t communicate, but is still kept alive by the medical crew. Thus the lyrics follow his plea to be put out of his misery.

A specific passage that inspired the song is:

How could a man lose as much of himself as I have and still live? When a man buys a lottery ticket you never expect him to win because it’s a million to one shot. But if he does win, you’ll believe it because one in a million still leaves one. If I’d read about a guy like me in the paper I wouldn’t believe it, cos it’s a million to one. But a million to ONE always leaves one. I’d never expect it to happen to me because the odds of it happening are a million to one. But a million to one always leaves one. One.

“One” marked the first time Metallica did a music video for their songs. The video featured footage from the film adaptation of Johnny Got His Gun directed by Trumbo himself, which the band bought the rights for to make incorporating it easier.

The song follows the theme of childhood fear, in nightmares, with the eponymous Sandman symbolizing the sleep that he dreads.  However, the Sandman of European folklore actually represents the bringer of good dreams.

In 2007, drummer Lars Ulrich told Uncut:

‘Enter Sandman’ was the first thing we came up with when we sat down for the songwriting process in July 1990. The 10-minute, 12-tempo-changes side of Metallica had run its course. We wanted to streamline and simplify things. We wrote the song in a day or two. All the bits of ‘Enter Sandman’ are derived from the main riff.

Meanwhile, James Hetfield told Uncut:

I wanted more of the mental thing where this kid gets manipulated by what adults say. You know when you wake up with that shit in your eye? That’s supposedly been put in there by the sandman to make you dream. So the guy in the song tells this little kid that and he kinda freaks. He can’t sleep after that and it works the opposite way. Instead of a soothing thing, the table’s turned.

Twenty years after the song’s release, producer Bob Rock shared the original concept of the song’s lyrics with Music Radar:

At first, based on the music and the riff, the band and their management thought it could be the first single. Then they heard James’ lyrics and realized the song was about crib death. That didn’t go over well. I sat down with James and talked to him about his words. I told him, ‘What you have is great, but it can be better. Does it have to be so literal?’ Not that I was thinking about the single; I just wanted him to make the song great. It was a process, him learning to say what he wanted but in a more poetic and open sort of way. He rewrote some lyrics and it was all there… the first single.","August 12, 1991",1991

","The title track off Master of Puppets is mainly about the effects drugs can have on a person’s life. It is the single most performed song in Metallica’s career, and always provides a great reaction from audiences, as Hetfield will leave the singing of the MASTER! exclamations to the audience (to great effect!).

The guitar riff between the last guitar solo section and final verse was heavily influenced by David Bowie’s song “Andy Warhol,” which Burton and Hammett were big fans of.","March 3, 1986",1986

praying for the end of
your wide awake nightmare

feeding on the screams of

This song is linguistically significant for containing the earliest known usage of the word “abacinate” (see that line’s annotation for more info).","October 7, 1986",1986

trapped in purgatory
a lifeless object alive
awaiting reprisal
death will be their acquittance
the sky is turning red
return to power draws near
fall into me the skys crimson tears
abolish the rules made of stone

pierced from below souls of my treacherous past
betrayed by many now ornaments dripping above

awaiting the hour of reprisal
your time slips away

raining blood
from a lacerated sky
bleeding its horror
creating my structure
now i shall reign in blood
","One of Slayer’s signature songs both concludes and gives its name to their most acclaimed album. Writers Kerry King and the late Jeff Hanneman have said it’s one of their favorite songs to play live, and it has been an almost permanent fixture in their live set lists for more than 30 years. Often, they perform in the midst of a rain of stage blood.



According to D.X. Ferris' book Reign in Blood, Hanneman explained,

It’s about a guy who’s in Purgatory ‘cause he was cast out of Heaven. He’s waiting for revenge and wants to fuck that place up.

King added,

The rest of the song explains what happens when he starts fucking people up. The lyrics ‘Return to power draws near’ is because he’s waiting to get strong enough again to overthrow Heaven. And then ‘Fall into me, the sky’s crimson tears’ is everybody’s blood flowing into him. So basically, ‘Raining Blood’ is all the angels' blood falling on him.","October 7, 1986",1986

He also admitted to killing two women in the 1950s. Gein was the inspiration for several famous horror movies and horror game villains, including Norman Bates from Psycho, Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Buffalo Bill from The Silence of the Lambs, and Eddie Gluskin from the video game Outlast.","October 9, 1990",1990

Domineering Deity is the Media, and The Immoral Observance is the public feeding into the lust and sex that the media has portrayed for people. The “forgotten children” are the generation of youth that can only look up to their “promiscuous mothers and incestuous fathers”.

come away with innocence and leave me with my sins
the air around me still feels like a cage
and love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

so if you love me let me go
and run away before i know
my heart is just too dark to care
i cant destroy what isnt there
deliver me into my fate
if im alone i cannot hate
i dont deserve to have you
ooh my smile was taken long ago
if i can change i hope i never know

i still press your letters to my lips
and cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
i couldnt face a life without your light (without your light)
but all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

so save your breath i will not hear
i think i made it very clear
you couldnt hate enough to love
is that supposed to be enough
i only wish you werent my friend
then i could hurt you in the end
i never claimed to be a saint
ooh my own was banished long ago
it took the death of hope to let you go

oh oh

so break yourself against my stones
and spit your pity in my soul
you never needed any help
you sold me out to save yourself
and i wont listen to your shame
you ran away youre all the same
angels lie to keep control
ooh my love was punished long ago
if you still care dont ever let me know
if you still care dont ever let me know
","“Snuff” is a relatively slow song, as compared to the majority of other songs on the All Hope Is Gone. The acoustic dark song tells the story of a man who falls in love and believes the other person feels the same towards them, just to realize they don’t feel that way.

This was the last released single featuring bassist Paul Gray and drummer Joey Jordison. Gray would pass away 8 months after release while Jordison would be fired via email 4 years after release. In later solo shows, Corey Taylor performed an acoustic version of this song as a tribute to Gray.","September 28, 2009",2009

In the video for “Psychosocial,” Slipknot burned the “purgatory masks” that they had revealed for during the promotion of the All Hope is Gone album in 2008.

That was a Shawn Crahan idea. Those are Mardi Gras heads of our faces from the death masks we wore in the ‘Vermillion’ video. It’s just a teaser, but it’s totally genius. When I first heard about it, I was like, ‘Are you fuckin’ kidding me?’ But then I saw the results, and I was like, ‘I totally get it!’ He’s got a good vision, man; he’s a great artist.

—Joey Jordison

More or less, we have these giant masks that we’re wearing, called ‘purgatory masks.’ They’re like giant death masks, and they represent ego.

It peaked at #5 on the US Rock Chart and reached #15 in the UK, where it remains their highest-charting song. In 2019, Billboard named it the band’s best song.

The music video was shot at a fan’s house, resulting in Roadrunner Records paying the fan’s family $50,000 for damages incurred in the shoot.



According to Corey Taylor:

“Duality” is about standing at the crossroads of your life, looking down both paths, and going, “Now what am I going to do?” Did you ever get that headache that is just not going to go away, and you end up sticking your thumb and middle finger so far into your eyes, just to stop the pain? It usually has to do with making a choice. You get to that point in everyday life when you have to make a decision that you may not want to, but you’re kind of pushed into that position. ""

Like all of the songs on “Vol. 3…”, Duality contains NO explicit lyrics, and was the first Slipknot single that was released without requiring a clean radio version.

It is also important for the entire album to remember that this is the album where Corey Taylor went sober and Clown dawned his “healing” mask.","May 4, 2004",2004

I do have bouts of severe depression, which are very, very hard to deal with sometimes. […] So I’ve really tried to deal with it as naturally as possible, and I know that sounds very hippie-like, but when you know yourself, and you know the habits that you can slip into so easily, you have to find alternatives. […]

—Corey Taylor, Rolling Stone

The music video for the song shows the band’s new masks, succeeding 2014’s .5: The Gray Chapter masks. The track was teased on the band’s official pages with three videos with captions featuring the song’s lyrics but with no sound snippets.



When talking about the album in 2018, Corey Taylor said what completely represents this track:

It’s complicated, it’s dark, it’s heavy, it’s heavy, it’s melodic, it’s fierce, it’s angry and it’s raw as hell. It’s going to be talking about a lot of things that people are going to need in their life.

Musically, the song mixes the heaviness of 2001’s Iowa in the verses with the melody and commercial side of 2008’s All Hope Is Gone in the chorus.","May 16, 2019",2019

i cry when angels deserve to die","Rick Rubin, who produced Toxicity for System of a Down, cites this song as one of his most important projects. He told Rolling Stone:

This song was originally going to be called “Self-Righteous Suicide,” and the record company rebelled. I remember wanting to go to the mat and keep the title, and the band decided, “Let’s call it ‘Chop Suey!’” which I thought was kind of funny.

Chop-suey is the Americanization of the Chinese quick dish tsap sui, which means “odds and ends, mixed bits” in the Cantonese dialect. The song title is a play on “Self-right-Chop Suey-cide,” that has a further sort of humor in that they mixed up a controversial word into a nonsensical word to create a more ‘radio-friendly’ title.

The song enjoyed success, climbing the charts after its August 2001 release before virtually disappearing from airwaves after 9/11. The song’s chorus, with its congratulatory “self-righteous suicide,” and lament, “I cry when angels deserve to die” was considered a bit too raw for listeners at the time. In the wake of the tragedy, Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) put out a memo to its subsidiary radio stations  temporarily blackballing (but not outright banning) it, along with 164 other “lyrically questionable” songs. Eventually, the record resurfaced on the charts—in part due to its earlier popularity, in part due to the lack of new singles released that September. However, it remains one of System of a Down’s worst performing US singles, particularly relative to the song’s global performance.

Although the lyrics are viewed as confrontational, the singer is actually challenging the listener to “wake up” and reconsider the way that they judge and deride people who are engaged in self-destructive behaviors. The song culminates in a biblical connection to Jesus before his death on the cross, with the singer ostensibly having chosen his “self-righteous suicide” so that these ‘sinners’ would be forgiven.","August 13, 2001",2001

Like their earlier song “Boom!,” it was written in protest against the Iraq War.

B.Y.O.B. means “Bring Your Own Bombs,” as opposed to the common interpretation “Bring Your Own Booze,” referring to the Iraq War as one big party for the United States, where instead of Jägerbombs they drop real ones.

It made onto numerous “Top 40” playlists around the globe, including Germany, New Zealand, Australia and the United States, and occasionally made it to #1 on other music shows.","March 29, 2005",2005

It was critically and commercially successful; the song was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 2003 Grammy Awards.

Although Daron Malakian said in some shows that “Aerials” doesn’t mean anything, the overall theme of the song is our mistaken views of ourselves as being individual and isolated from the rest and how we actually are a tiny part of something greater, from which we come when we are born, and to which we go when we die. It speaks of clinging to life and not accepting death, because we see death as an ending, not as another step of existence. When we die, our matter is decomposed and is transferred to things like worms that feed on us, to the atmosphere in the form of gas, and to the ground and plants that feed on him. We are always moving through the circle of existence, there is no stillness, only movement, and transformation.

On many CD issues, “Aerials” is listed as a single track with a length of 6:11. In reality, “Aerials” itself ends at around 3:54, while the rest of the length is taken up by a hidden track unofficially named “Arto.”","September 4, 2001",2001

mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm hmmhmm","“Yesterday” is the most covered song in history, with over 2,000  versions having been recorded. A spare, haunting song of lost love from the early Beatles catalog, it was sung perfectly by a young Paul McCartney.

McCartney dreamed the entire melody before he arranged the music with George Martin. According to Rolling Stone:

‘It fell out of bed,’ Paul McCartney once said about the origins of ‘Yesterday.’ ‘I had a piano by my bedside, and I must have dreamed it, because I tumbled out of bed and put my hands on the piano keys and I had a tune in my head. It was just all there, a complete thing. I couldn’t believe it. It came too easy.’

The working lyrics Paul used to fit the tune before he wrote the actual words started with “Scrambled eggs / Oh my baby how I love your legs / Not as much as I love scrambled eggs.” Picking up on that famous trivia, Jimmy Fallon eventually developed the rest of “Scrambled eggs” and recorded it with Paul.","September 13, 1965",1965

It’s been suggested that each verse talks about one of the members of The Beatles or a self-portrait of Lennon himself. However, by his own admission, Lennon often simply filled his lyrics with non-sequiturs:

The thing was created in the studio. It’s gobbledygook; Come Together was an expression that Leary had come up with for his attempt at being president or whatever he wanted to be, and he asked me to write a campaign song. I tried and tried, but I couldn’t come up with one. But I came up with this, Come Together, which would’ve been no good to him – you couldn’t have a campaign song like that, right?

John Lennon stated that he thought the song was written as a form of blessing from Paul McCartney for his and Yoko’s relationship. They were touched by McCartney’s act and Cynthia said she would always remember his “gesture of care and concern in coming to see us.”



While it was being recorded, producer George Martin voiced his discontent with the abnormal song length. Coming in at over seven minutes long–with four of those minutes comprising the outro–Martin expressed the opinion that radio DJs would not play the song. Lennon responded with: “They will if it’s us.”

Once released, the song performed absolutely fantastically. With its seven-minute runtime, it became the longest single to top the British music charts in its day. In the United States, the song spent nine weeks at #1, making it the best-performing Beatles single. Additionally, at the time it tied for the record of longest-sitting chart-topping single.

The reaction to the song did not wane. It stayed as The Beatles' best performing U.S. single and is considered by many music critics as being one of the best songs of all time. Rolling Stone lists it at #8. It sits at #10 on Billboard’s 55th Anniversary countdown. In addition, the song is the most referenced musical performance.","August 26, 1968",1968

He documents events through history that could be seen as “works of the devil.” The Rolling Stones took some serious heat for singing a song from the devil’s perspective, but the point of the song is more about the flaws in mankind. It was never intended as devil worship.

There was a rumor that this song was playing when a fan died at the Rolling Stones gig at the Altamont Free Concert, but it was actually “Under My Thumb.” Despite that, the Stones didn’t perform this song for at least 5 years (as they played it on tour in 1975) after the incident.

These lyrics were inspired by the book “The Master and Margarita” written by Mikhail Bulgakov. In this book Devil (and his ‘gang’) roam around Moscow in the 1930s and play tricks on stupid/greedy people.","February 1, 1969",1969

What’s with the comma in the title? Maybe they are saying “paint it, black!” like “hey, Mr. Black, please paint my door!” It was the record company’s idea to add the comma. Most compilations and internet radio stations remove the comma.
A cover of the music was used in the “Westworld” series aired on HBO directed by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy.","May 13, 1966",1966

Keith Richards, in his book Life on Jagger’s lyrics writing process:

They started running down Brown Sugar the first night, but they didn’t get a take. I watched Mick write the lyrics. It took him maybe forty-five minutes; it was disgusting. He wrote it down as fast as he could move his hand. I’d never seen anything like it. He had one of those yellow legal pads, and he’d write a verse a page, just write a verse and then turn the page, and when he had three pages filled, they started to cut it. It was amazing!""

The song is thought to have been inspired by soul singer Claudia Lennear, who was also the inspiration behind David Bowie’s “Lady Grinning Soul”.

There are several different ways to interpret this song. The most straightforward is a meditation on white male on black female sex  and how power has influenced it. Alternatively it could be more generally about interracial sex or black sex. Finally, as meta-fiction: Mick Jagger plunders the musical history of black people from slave rhythms, to spirituals, to blues, to honky tonk. And further is willing to proudly crow about how tempting and good they are.

The first reading is probably what was intended, but given the rollicking rock, the final is not inappropriate whether intended or not.","April 16, 1971",1971

","“Gimme Shelter” is the opening track of the Rolling Stones’s 1969 album Let It Bleed (where it was actually spelled “Gimmie Shelter”, but the more accurate spelling was adopted afterwards).

It paints a bleak world view inspired by the Vietnam war, as put by Mick Jagger:

“Well, it’s a very rough, very violent era. The Vietnam War. Violence on the screens, pillage and burning. And Vietnam was not war as we knew it in the conventional sense. The thing about Vietnam was that it wasn’t like World War II, and it wasn’t like Korea, and it wasn’t like the Gulf War. It was a real nasty war, and people didn’t like it. People objected, and people didn’t want to fight it…” As for the song itself, he concluded, “That’s a kind of end-of-the-world song, really. It’s apocalypse; the whole record’s like that.”

However, the song’s inspiration was not Vietnam or social unrest, but Keith Richards seeing people scurrying for shelter from a sudden London rainstorm.
“I had been sitting by the window of my friend Robert Fraser’s apartment on Mount Street in London with an acoustic guitar when suddenly the sky went completely black and an incredible monsoon came down. It was just people running about looking for shelter — that was the germ of the idea. We went further into it until it became, you know, rape and murder are ‘just a shot away’.”

The female vocals were sung by session singer Merry Clayton. Jagger explained in the 2003 book According To… The Rolling Stones:

The use of the female voice was producer Jimmy Miller’s idea. It would be one of those moments along the lines of ‘I hear a girl on this track – get one on the phone.’ Clayton, pregnant at the time, reportedly suffered a miscarriage soon after the session.

On the 1969, 1972 and 1975 U.S. tours as a straight ahead hard rock song without female accompaniment, it didn’t return to the setlist until 1989 when Clayton’s vocal turn usually went to Lisa Fischer. The 50th anniversary tour had some special appearances by Lady Gaga (New Jersey), Florence Welch (London) and Mary J. Blige (also London ). Grace Potter also had the honors in 2015.

U.S. President Barack Obama told Rolling Stone in an interview while campaigning for his first term that the Stones were one his musical heroes (along with Stevie Wonder) and “Gimme Shelter” was his favourite Stones song.

Gimme Shelter* is also the title to the Maysles brothers' 1970 documentary film of the Stones' 1969 U.S. tour climaxing with the infamous Altamont concert near San Francisco.","December 5, 1969",1969

The song was famously used in the iconic opening scene of Francis Ford Coppola’s 1979 film Apocalypse Now, with images of the Vietnam War to the cinematic battle towards the end of the movie between Willard (Martin Sheen’s character) and Kurtz (Marlon Brando’s character).

In a 1969 interview with Rolling Stone, Morrison said the song means something different every time he listened to it:

It started out as a simple good-bye song… Probably just to a girl, but I see how it could be a goodbye to a kind of childhood. I really don’t know. I think it’s sufficiently complex and universal in its imagery that it could be almost anything you want it to be.

Several musical influences are apparent in Robby Krieger’s composition of this song, including Chopin’s “Funeral March.”","January 4, 1967",1967

This evolved out of a jam session when the band was messing around with “Ghost Riders In The Sky,” a cowboy song by Stan Jones. It was Jim Morrison’s idea to alter the title to “Riders On The Storm.”

Ray Manzarek used the electric piano to create the effect of rain.

If you listen closely, you can hear Jim Morrison whispering the lyrics over his own singing, which causes a kind of creepy effect.

This was Morrison’s final contribution as a rock star. Ray Manzarek told Uncut magazine September 2011: “There’s a whisper voice on ‘Riders on the Storm,’ if you listen closely, a whispered overdub that Jim adds beneath his vocal. That’s the last thing he ever did. An ephemeral, whispered overdub.”

The single was shortened for radio play. Some of the piano solo was cut out.

Snoop Dogg covered the song for the 2004 game, Need for Speed: Underground 2, in a remixed version produced by Fredwreck. The cover was dubbed over the original track.

","One of the Doors first songs, written primarily by the band’s guitarist, Robby Krieger, (who also wrote three other big hits – “Touch Me”, “Love Me Two Times” and “Love Her Madly”).

Light My Fire was their first top charting hit, succeeding first as an LP track, then shortened by more than 4 minutes, and issued as a single. The song is consistently featured in various “greatest songs ever” lists, landing #35 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

The song perfectly combines Jim Morrison’s powerful voice with Robby Krieger’s guitar playing, and Ray Manzarek’s iconic organ riff and solo.

Ray Manzarek said in an interview with NPR about the song, but it was true for the whole album:

We were aware of Muddy Waters. We were aware of Howlin' Wolf and John Coltrane and Miles Davis. Plus, Jan and Dean and The Beach Boys and the surf sound. Robby Krieger brings in some flamenco guitar. I bring a little bit of classical music along with the blues and jazz, and certainly John Densmore was heavy into jazz. And Jim brings in beatnik poetry and French symbolist poetry, and that’s the blend of The Doors as the sun is setting into the Pacific Ocean at the end, the terminus of Western civilization. That’s the end of it. Western civilization ends here in California at Venice Beach, so we stood there inventing a new world on psychedelics.","April 1, 1967",1967

Drummer John Densmore recalled the moment in his 1991 biography, Riders on the Storm: My Life with Jim Morrison and The Doors:

[Morrison said] ‘Yeah, I feel really good about this one. It just came to me all of a sudden […] in a flash—as I was sitting up there on the ridge looking out over the city.’ His eyes were wild with excitement. ‘I scribbled it down as fast as I could. It felt great to be writing again.’ He looked down at the crumpled paper in his hand and sang the chorus in his haunting blues voice.

Morrison and Krieger are credited with writing the song. It reached #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 in October 1967.","September 1, 1967",1967

and disciplinary remains mercifully
yes and um i’m with you derek this star nonsense
yes yes now which is it
i am sure of it

so so you think you can tell
heaven from hell blue skies from pain
can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail
a smile from a veil do you think you can tell
did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts
hot ashes for trees hot air for a cool breeze
cold comfort for change did you exchange
a walkon part in the war
for a lead role in a cage


how i wish how i wish you were here
were just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
running over the same old ground what have we found
the same old fears wish you were here
","“Wish You Were Here” is the title track on Pink Floyd’s 1975 album. The song’s lyrics encompass writer Roger Waters‘ feelings of alienation from other people, drawing particular inspiration from his old friend Syd Barrett, the founder of Pink Floyd  who left the band due to mental health issues. The song forms part of a concept album focusing on absence and disenchantment with the music industry. The song “Shine on you Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-9)” was already an homage to Syd, while this one also grieves his absence. The other two songs on the album (“Welcome to the Machine” and “Have a Cigar”) express the band’s newfound distaste for the pressures of the music industry, pressures that they feel helped cause Syd to crack, thus tying the album together as a coherent piece.  David Gilmour and Roger Waters collaborated to write the music.

This was a rare case of the Pink Floyd primary songwriters Roger Waters and David Gilmour mutually collaborating on a song – they rarely wrote together. Gilmour had the opening riff written and was playing it in the studio at a fast pace when Roger Waters heard it and asked him to play it slower. The song built from there, with the pair writing the music for the chorus and verses together, and Waters adding the lyrics.

The song reflected the feeling of the band while they were recording the album. Waters felt they were not putting a full effort into the recording sessions.

When this song starts, it sounds like it is coming from an AM radio somewhere in the distance. It represents the distance between the listener and the music.

At 42 seconds, you can also hear Richard Wright cough. When he heard the song later, it inspired him to quit smoking.

While not a single upon release, it earned this status with a version recorded on the live album Pulse, where the cover depicted two lost souls staring into fish bowls.","September 12, 1975",1975
pink floyd,time,"
ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
waiting for someone or something to show you the way
tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
and then one day you find ten years have got behind you
no one told you when to run you missed the starting gun

and you run and you run to catch up with the sun but its sinking
racing around to come up behind you again
the sun is the same in a relative way but youre older
shorter of breath and one day closer to death
every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time
plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
hanging on in quiet desperation is the english way
the time is gone the song is over thought id something more to say

home home again
i like to be here when i can
and when i come home cold and tired
its good to warm my bones beside the fire
far away across the field
the tolling of the iron bell
calls the faithful to their knees
to hear the softly spoken magic spells","This is the only track on the album that credits all 4 members of the band. It’s about how time can slip by, but many people do not realize it until it is too late. Roger Waters got the idea when he realized he was no longer preparing for anything in life, but was right in the middle of it at the age of 29.

The idea in “Time” is a similar exhortation to “Breathe.” To be here now, this is it. Make the most of it.

—Roger Waters

Doris Troy, Lesley Duncan, Liza Strike, and Barry St John sang on backing vocals, which were processed through an early pitch-changing device called a Frequency Translator.

Ian Emes commissioned this animated film that was projected during live performances of the song.

","Pink’s emotional journey into the past is both interrupted and heightened when his management breaks into the hotel room and has a doctor inject him with a drug that will snap him out of his drug-induced malaise, ensuring that he can still perform at a concert later that evening.

Roger Waters wrote the lyrics inspired by an experience where he was injected with tranquilizers before a 1977 concert in Philadelphia:

That was the longest two hours of my life, trying to do a show when you can hardly lift your arm.","November 30, 1979",1979

“Part 1” had come two tracks earlier, and even the immediately preceding song, “The Happiest Days of Our Lives” was thematically similar, to the point where one radio edit combines both songs.

David Gilmour credits producer Bob Ezrin for the song’s disco sound:

He said to me, “Go to a couple of clubs and listen to what’s happening with disco music,” so I forced myself out and listened to loud, four-to-the-bar bass drums and stuff and thought, Gawd, awful! Then we went back and tried to turn one of the “Another Brick in the Wall” parts into one of those so it would be catchy. We did the same exercise on “Run Like Hell.”

But Roger Waters is more reluctant to embrace the disco classification:

The song ran slow, almost like a chant or mantra, at 100 beats per minute. To give it a bit of punch, Bob Ezrin added a kick drum on every beat, which made the song a different animal than something strummed on an acoustic guitar. It’s not a disco beat, as many people have said, but more of a heart beat. It’s very cool.","November 23, 1979",1979

The guitar solo was ranked as the 37th greatest solo of all-time by Guitar World. Amazingly, it was recorded in one take.

The lyrics were written by frontman Axl Rose as a dedication to his then-girlfriend Erin Everly. Once he heard guitarist Slash noodling downstairs, Axl found the musical backing he needed.

In 2015, the Australian website MAX TV revealed the song’s striking similarity to “Unpublished Critics,” a song released in 1981 by the band Australian Crawl. Duff McKagan, bass player for Guns N' Roses during the recording of “Sweet Child O' Mine,” said the similarities were startling. Speaking to Radio.com in 2015:

No wonder it’s their usual setlist opener (except in the Chinese Democracy tour, where the eponymous song did the honors) and a mainstay of many sports events.

According to an interview published by Hit Parader in March 1988:

Axl wrote the words while visiting his long-time friend Tori in Kingston, Washington, a town outside of Seattle. It’s a big city, but at the same time, it’s still a small city compared to Los Angeles and the things that you’re gonna learn. It seemed a lot more rural up there. Axl just wrote how it looked to him. If someone comes to town and they want to find something, they can find whatever they want.

There has been said that Axl and a friend heard the exact same phrase that is used in the song from the lips of a homeless man, as soon as they climbed down from a bus, just after arriving in New York:

Clocking in at almost 9 minutes, “November Rain” features Rose’s desperate vocal and heartfelt piano. A depressing autumn tale of lost love, Slash’s inspired soaring guitar solos and the band’s dramatic dynamics over a crescendo of a swirling string section backed by a powerful choir make the song an instant classic.

The song had been a work-in-progress since 1983. Former GNR co-founder and guitarist Tracii Guns explained:

When we were doing that EP for L.A. Guns, like ‘83? He was playing “November Rain”—and it was called “November Rain”—you know, on piano. Way back then, it was the only thing he knew how to play, but it was his. He’d go, “Someday this song is gonna be really cool.” And I’d go, “It’s cool now.” “But it’s not done”, you know, he used to say. And, like, anytime we’d be at a hotel or anywhere, there’d be a piano; he’d just kinda play that music. And I’d go, “When are you gonna finish that already”, you know? And he’d go, “I don’t know what to do with it.”

The lyrics and video are based on a short story by Del James called “Without You” from a collection called The Language of Fear, which was brought back to market in 2008 after being out of print. The new version of the book contains an intro by Axl Rose, who wrote:

Del James has a personal knowledge of most of the situations he writes about, and has a love of the gutter from having been there.

James has also contributed lyrics to GNR songs The Garden"" and “Yesterdays” and has directed several music videos.

“November Rain” hit #3 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, #9 in Germany where it charted for 51 weeks, #5 in Australia riding the Top 10 for 22 weeks and #7 in New Zealand ending 1992 as their second best-selling single.","September 17, 1991",1991

It was one of the first compositions written by Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin while in Los Angeles, being present in the band’s demo tape to Geffen in 1986. Axl once described the song as being about “A woman leaving a man.” The girl is someone who Izzy Stradlin once dated, and who Axl was attracted to. Axl really liked this girl, but things couldn’t work out between them, which really hurt him and inspired him to write the song.

The music video started a trilogy, and translates how Axl’s life was going awry:

With our video for “Don’t Cry,” and the fight that Stephanie Seymour, (his then-girlfriend) and I had over the gun, you don’t necessarily know what’s going on. But in real life that happened with Erin Everly (his ex-wife) and myself. I was going to shoot myself. We fought over the gun and I finally let her win.

According to Matt Sorum, “November Rain,” “Don’t Cry” and “Estranged” were conceived as one song, and the three tracks form a trilogy of sorts. Sorum played the same drum fill throughout those three songs and took some criticism for doing so—notably from former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy.

Sorum points out that this was intentional, a way of unifying the songs. “That was my part in tying enough songs together to make it one voice,” he told us.","September 17, 1991",1991

It became an international success, reaching #1 in seven countries and peaking at #9 in the United States. Seventeen years after its initial release, “Bohemian Rhapsody” re-entered the pop charts in the US, peaking at #2 after being featured in the 1992 hit movie Wayne’s World. In 2002, the song was listed at #1 in a Guinness World Records poll as Britain’s favourite single of all time—ranking higher than four Beatles tracks and “Imagine” by John Lennon.

Complex and operatic both musically and lyrically, “Bohemian Rhapsody” (like Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” and The Eagles‘ “Hotel California”) has attracted endless fan theories and commentary. The surviving band members have claimed that the narrative is based on the Faust legend; critics have found possible sources in opera and Freddie Mercury’s personal biography; but like any good piece of art, it’s open to interpretation.

The word “Bohemian” seems to refer to a group of artists and musicians from the 19th century, known for defying convention and living with disregard for standards; as opposed to the region of Bohemia in the Czech Republic. Meanwhile the term “rhapsody” (derived from the Greek: ῥαψῳδός or rhapsōidos for a reciter of epic poetry, or a rhapsodist) is a piece of classical music with distinct sections that are played as one movement. Rhapsodies often feature dense themes or narratives.

As of December 2018, “Bohemian Rhapsody” is the most streamed song of the 20th century.

“Bohemian Rhapsody” has got a very diverse song structure. It includes:
• Intro (0:00-0:49)
• Ballad section (0:49-2:37)
• Brian May‘s’ guitar solo (2:37-3:05)
• Operatic verse (3:05-4:07)
• Hard-rock verse (4:07-4:54)
• Coda (4:54-5:55)","October 31, 1975",1975

Critically, the song performed well, releasing as a single after the release of album Jazz. Despite reaching number 9 on the UK charts and later going Platinum, it only hit 86 on the US charts. Time has only increased its popularity, as it is often included in “Greatest Hit” compilations and stands as their second most played song on Spotify with over 750 million plays as of January 2020.","November 10, 1978",1978

Peaking at #2 in the UK, the song became a hit in seven other European countries as well. “Killer Queen” was the first Queen single to successfully ‘cross the pond’, becoming a top 20 hit in the U.S. and Canada, as well as a top 30 hit in Australia.

In the New Musical Express of November 2, 1974, the song’s writer and Queen’s frontman Freddie Mercury elucidates on this song: “It’s about a high class call girl. I’m trying to say that classy people can be whores as well. That’s what the song is about, though I’d prefer people to put their interpretation upon it – to read into it what they like.”

While it may seem like a typical popular song, the structure utilised in the song is quite unusual. There are 4 bar phrases immediately followed by 5 bar phrases and then 2 bar phrases, with tempo changing from 12/8 to 6/8 and vice versa.

The main key being Eb major is very unorthodox for Rock music, as guitars don’t usually play flats. Brian May, who pioneered a heavier hard rock sound, had been struck with hepatitis during the majority of the recording. Upon initially hearing the song, Brian was shocked over the more progressive, lighter sound. Nevertheless, the rest of the band left space for Brian to record his own iconic guitar melodies.

The song includes prominent uses of multi-tracking, not just on the vocals, but also in the guitar solo. Other effects used include the flanger (pitch bends), panning (sound moving from the left ear to the right), portamento/glissando (sliding from one note to another), distortion (giving a creamy feel), wah-wah on the guitar, string bending and sliding.

The band had decided not to use the ubiquitous synthesiser, as they thought it was superfluous. Instead, instrumentation utilised includes a jangle piano (detuned), drum kit, bass guitar, electric guitar and vocals.



The song “Killer Queen” may also be recognized by fans of the Japanese manga series “JoJo’s Bizzare Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable” by Hirohiko Araki, in which a character named Yoshikage Kira has a spiritual manifestation called a “Stand” named “Killer Queen”. To avoid copyright issues, most American publications of the series renamed the Stand “Deadly Queen”.","October 11, 1974",1974

The song’s success and omnipresence in the early ‘90s brought the band unrivaled popularity. Eventually, Kurt grew tired of it and removed it from their live set as often as possible.

Rock history recalls Kathleen Hanna from Bikini Kill scrawling the phrase “Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit” in spray paint on a wall, from which Kurt took the title. Some say Kurt took it as a call for a revolution, in reference to the Bikini Kill-led riot grrl movement; but according to producer Butch Vig, Kurt just thought the phrase “was stupid,” and it didn’t really mean anything at all. However, it was later revealed that Hanna was referring to the brand of deodorant worn by Kurt’s then-girlfriend and Hanna’s then-bandmate Tobi Vail.

In a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone, Cobain said:

I was trying to write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it. When I heard [them] for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I should have been in that band—or at least in a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard.

It was one of the last tracks written and recorded for the album, and the final version is comprised of the second take out of just three takes, according to Montage of Heck and other sources.

“Smells Like Teen Spirit” was voted #9 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.","September 10, 1991",1991

(“Smells Like Teen Spirit” was imagined as more for committed grunge fans.) However, the surprise success of “Smells Like Teen Spirit”, which came to be considered their signature song, made this plan inconsequential. Despite this overshadowing, the song had good commercial success, peaking at 32 on the Billboard and 9 on the UK singles charts.

The song’s lyrics appear to have a foreshadowing tone given Cobain’s death by self-inflicted gunshot wound. However, in the context of the song they seem to be an ironic comment about people’s bad intentions.

Kurt Cobain spoke about the lyrics on Nevermind: It’s An Interview:

The lines in the song are really contradictory. One after another they are kind of a rebuttal to each line. It’s kind of confusing I guess. It’s just about people and what they are expected to act like.

The song’s distinctive guitar riff was heavily borrowed from Killing Joke’s song “The Eighties,” a fact that made the band hesitate to release the song as a single. Nirvana manager Danny Goldberg told Rolling Stone:

Kurt was nervous about ‘Come as You Are’ because it was too similar to a Killing Joke song “Eighties”, but we all thought it was still the better song to go with. And, he was right, Killing Joke later did complain about it.

Despite their complaints, Killing Joke never filed suit against Nirvana.

The song also includes a rare extended guitar solo for Cobain, whose immersion in stripped-down punk aesthetics meant he didn’t often engage in musical self-indulgence. Producer Butch Vig recalled:

Kurt really did not play a lot of solos. This one is more of a melodic part based on the vocal melody. It’s not trying to show off pyrotechnics. It complements the melody of the song.

In Aberdeen, Washington, which is the birthplace of Cobain, he is commemorated by a sign which says “Come as you are”:","March 2, 1992",1992

“Heart-Shaped Box” received critical acclaim during radio airplay and reached number 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts.

The music video was directed by Anton Corbijn and it was conceptualized by Kurt. During the song’s first verse, the old man from the hospital climbs onto a crow-ridden Christian cross. The second verse introduces a young girl in a white robe and peaked cap reaching for human fetuses in a tree, and an overweight woman in a suit with human organs painted onto it and with angel wings affixed to her back.

While most of the video was devised by Cobain, Corbijn added elements such as the intentionally artificial crows, a ladder for the old man to climb onto the cross with, and a box with a heart at the top that the band performs inside of during the song’s final chorus.

The title invokes lithium salts, a key drug in treating the disorder.

Chart wise, it peaked at #1 on Billboard’s Alternative Songs and was certified Gold by RIAA.

The song was produced entirely acoustically and features an upright bass, cello, and brushes on the drums. The track is also the only blink-182 track to-date in which Travis uses brushes instead of drumsticks.

Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus wrote the song in a two-part way, combining two songs together to make this track. The song was inspired by The Cure’s song “The Lovecats” and contains a reference to the film The Nightmare Before Christmas.

The track went on to inspire The Chainsmokers‘ “Closer.”","November 18, 2003",2003

DeLonge wrote this song about his then-girlfriend and eventual wife, Jenna Jenkins. His anecdotes—like the one about her leaving flowers on the stairs, are actually true. In a Rolling Stone profile from the year this song came out, Hoppus said:

Tom is totally, 100 percent faithful to his girlfriend. He’s pretty straightforward: He hangs out with his girlfriend, and he believes in aliens.

It was the last song the pop punk trio recorded for their third album Enema of the State and was one of three singles from the album that launched them into mainstream success. That album would remain their most successful album to date.

DeLonge began this song with a guitar riff and wanted to make a song with a lot of “na na na’s,” a homage to his punk idols, the Ramones. He told Kerrang!:

Because it was so simple, it wasn’t so much fun to play. But once we put it all together, and played it as a band, we all looked at each other and said, ‘This song’s huge!’

The video for this song is a parody of the Backstreet Boys video for “I Want It That Way”. Mark Hoppus met his wife, Skye Everly, an MTV executive, on the set of the video shoot.","June 1, 1999",1999

whats my age again","Arguably one of the greatest pop-punk anthems and one of the most popular blink-182 songs. “What’s My Age Again?” was written by Mark Hoppus and was inspired by the fact that he was often pointed out as ‘immature’. The original title was “Peter Pan Complex,” but their record company (MCA) changed it, believing people wouldn’t understand its meaning.

The song follows a character (most probably Mark Hoppus himself) who is 23 years old but still acts like a child. He pulls up pranks and jokes that annoy people and is left wondering if he is portraying his real age. He finally concludes that he shouldn’t care what people think of him and continues his childish ways.","June 1, 1999",1999

“Adam” is used as a metaphor towards Mark’s depression he experienced while on tour with Blink-182. He stated:

Tom and Travis always had girlfriends waiting back home, so they had something to look forward to at the end of the tour. But I didn’t, so it was always like, I was lonely on tour, but then I got home and it didn’t matter because there was nothing there for me anyway.

“Adam’s Song” is also commonly attributed to the urban myth of Adam Krieger, a fictional character whose suicide letter is falsely portrayed as being the original letter that the band received before writing the song. This fake suicide letter, that is often posted online via places like tumblr, is fictitional and was originally written for a play.

The song’s title is also a reference to a skit from the cult classic HBO sketch show, “Mr. Show With Bob and David”, where in the sketch a band called Titanica writes a song called “Try Again (Adam’s Song)” with the intent of encouraging a fan to kill himself so they won’t be able to take him on tour after said fan tried to kill himself after hearing their song “Try Suicide.”","June 1, 1999",1999

im still into you","A very upbeat and happy number off their fourth studio album, Paramore, that seems to wrap up lead singer Hayley Williams and lead singer of band What’s Eating Gilbert/New Found Glory guitarist Chad Gilbert’s relationship. Still into You is the ninth track on the album and the second to be released as a single.

Still Into You peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100, at the time the second-highest a Paramore song had ever reached. Hayley talked about its commercial success when the song was played during her hosting appearance on the Sirius XM Hits 1 Weekend Countdown:

This song, I’m so so happy that this song is getting played on the radio. It’s probably my favorite Paramore song that we’ve ever written, actually. It’s about commitment to that one person that you just fall in love with and you have to just choose and you have to work so hard to stay in love. It’s not an easy task. It’s not a walk in the park, if you will.”

She told DIY that during the writing process, she knew it had the potential to be big.

Still Into You was one that five minutes into writing, it scared me. I loved it so much that it really actually scared me. Like, I feel like this is a big song, but you never know.”

Still, Hayley said during the band’s interview on Good Morning America that the song nearly wasn’t released as a single:

We just didn’t think that a love song would work as a Paramore hit. But we’ve always loved it. It was just like really? That’s going to work?”

The song highlights the band’s shift to more of a pop sound, something they had reservations about doing, especially when it came to the song’s chorus. Hayley said in Still Into You’s Beyond the Video, “When we got to the chorus I remember asking Taylor. I was like, “Is this too poppy? Can I do this? Can I say it like this or can I sing it like this?” And I just remember Taylor being like, “Do you like it?” And I was like, “I love it!” And he was like, then who cares, just do it anyways. I think that’s sort of a testament to how the entire writing and recording process went. If we liked something and we believed in it, we did it. We didn’t back down from it just because it was different.”

Hayley talked to Fuse about Chad’s reaction when she first showed him the song.

He got super shy. He didn’t look at me the whole time that we listened to it. Of course I was super psyched like, ‘Look at this song about you! YEAH!’ I’m psyched because Paramore, we don’t have a lot of love songs. I can probably count on one hand how many happy, positive songs that we’ve ever written. So I’ve just always been super emo at heart. So yeah, I’m just really excited that we have a song like this. Because it feels so good.”","March 14, 2013",2013

You can run on the fumes of being a teenager for as long as you want, but eventually life hits you real hard.

The playful ‘80s vibe of the song is also contrasted with Hayley’s new look; she dyed her trademark bright hair a dull white as a kind of “blank slate.”



“Hard Times” was released on April 19, 2017 as the lead single from Paramore’s fifth album After Laughter, released on May 12, 2017. It is also their comeback single after a three-year hiatus and the first since drummer Zac Farro’s return.","April 19, 2017",2017

it just feels so good","The lead single from Paramore’s second album Riot!. It’s been featured in numerous video games and also nominated for the Best Video award from 2007’s Kerrang! Awards.

Hayley went on to say the song reflects how her angsty 17-year-old self-dealt with a close friend (who she was possibly falling in love with) but was becoming distant – and thus is not necessarily something she identifies after nearly a decade.

On May 31, 2015, Hayley said about the track:

“Misery Business” is not a set of lyrics that I relate to as a 26-year-old woman. I haven’t related to it in a very long time. those words were written when I was 17… admittedly, from a very narrow-minded perspective. It wasn’t really meant to be this big philosophical statement about anything. it was quite literally a page in my diary about a singular moment I experienced as a high schooler.

Hayley announced on September 9, 2018 that Paramore will no longer be performing this track on stage again.

In 2020, reflecting on the early years, Hayley admitted that the song was about Josh:

When I was 13 or 14 and I had a crush on Josh, he didn’t like me back. He would go hang out with his girlfriend, who I wrote “Misery Business” about because I was a dick.","April 13, 2007",2007
paramore,the only exception,"
when i was younger i saw my daddy cry
and curse at the wind
he broke his own heart and i watched
as he tried to reassemble it
and my momma swore that she would
never let herself forget
and that was the day that i promised
id never sing of love if it does not exist

but darling
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception

maybe i know somewhere deep in my soul
that love never lasts
and weve got to find other ways to make it alone
or keep a straight face
and ive always lived like this
keeping a comfortable distance
and up until now i had sworn to myself that im content
with loneliness
because none of it was ever worth the risk
well you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception

ive got a tight grip on reality but i cant
let go of whats in front of me here
i know youre leaving in the morning when you wake up
leave me with some kind of proof its not a dream
whoaohoh

you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception
you are the only exception

and im on my way to believing
oh and im on my way to believing","“The Only Exception” the third single from Paramore’s brand new eyes was co-written between Hayley Williams and Josh Farro at a time when the band was a quintet, the song is a soft ballad, which provides musical diversity to the album. Hayley Williams explained to Kerrang! in 2009:

I’ve never written lyrics like this before. The first verse is about where I think the fear to be open or vulnerable started. Ever since the first story in Kerrang!, everyone has known about my family issues and domestic whatever, it’s something that’s kinda stayed with me and I’ve learned from. I played this song to my mom and there were tears. It was kind of embarrassing.

Hayley Williams told Alternative Press in 2010:

This is the first love song I’ve ever written. And even if I’ve tried in the past, this is the first one that I’m really proud of. I like that I was able to express the fact that I have always been really afraid of love – and I still am at times – but the excitement and the hope that it exists is still very evident in the lyrics. So it’s not like I’m a total cynic! Love is a good thing, kids.

In terms of its success as a single, it notably reached 24th on the US Billboard’s Top 100 and 31st on the UK’s Single Chart.","September 29, 2009",2009

The song, particularly John Frusciante’s guitar work, sounds different from the rest of the album. That is because the band originally planned to scrap the song because they couldn’t find the music to match Kiedis' lyrics, but Anthony encouraged Frusciante to get creative because he knew they could be dealing with a great song. From his autobiography Scar Tissue:

“I showed ""Californication” to John, and he loved the lyrics and started writing some music. But for some reason, even though there was a perfect song in there, we couldn’t find it. We tried ten different arrangements and ten different choruses, and nothing ever worked. All these other songs were pouring out of us. We’d been working for a few weeks when someone started playing an ultra-sparse riff that sounded like nothing we’d ever done before. As soon as I heard it, I knew it was our new song.""

The music video features the band as characters in a fake video game, exploring California and often seeing the bad things going on behind the scenes.

This song was one of their biggest hits, peaking at #69 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #1 on the Modern and Mainstream Rock charts, and, according to Flea, “Californication is the best record the Chili Peppers have ever made.”

Supporting Kiedis' statements on his autobiography Scar Tissue, an “alternate version” of Californication leaked onto the internet, an early demo from the Californication sessions.","June 8, 1999",1999

here i stay","The song is about front man Anthony Kiedis and the period in his life when he walked around Los Angeles sad and very alone, finding solace in the streets and hills and the wind…. thinking about his dead friend and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak, and the heroin overdose that claimed him. They both had smack habits and used to score – and sometimes shoot up – “under a traffic bridge” in a seedy part of the city.

Originally a poem by Anthony Kiedis, this was written during a time when Anthony felt that his sobriety was distancing him from the rest of the band. He arrived at rehearsal during one of his sober periods and found Flea and John smoking pot. When John first joined the band, he and Anthony were inseparable, but in this period, he knew they weren’t even really friends anymore. He wrote these lyrics as a poem while driving home from rehearsal on LA’s 101 freeway.

This leads to the themes of isolation, and made him feel as if Los Angeles was his only friend he could trust.

This song almost never happened, Kiedis was reluctant to express what he felt and didn’t feel it would fit the band’s style. But Rick Rubin discovered it along with the rest of Kiedis’s poetry and demanded that he make it into a song. It peaked at number 2 on the Billboard charts, and helped send the Chili Peppers into the mainstream.

Throughout the track, Anthony Kiedis highlights the predominant theme of nurturing an inner, personal energy. He addresses the verses to the listener in an instructional tone, whilst referencing inspirational figures such as Julia Butterfly Hill, Charlie Parker, and Defunkt.

A 2002 Interview with Spin Magazine revealed that the song is one that uses the band’s technique of writing lyrics to establish a rhythm, rather than making a rhythm to establish lyrics.

The track was accompanied by a surreal music video inspired by the “One-Minute Sculptures” of Austrian artist Erwin Wurm, in which the four band members perform random abstract actions worthy of display in an art gallery.

","A single off of Californication describing the struggles addicts go through to get sober and how they are viewed different when they return to reality. Scar tissue is a good comparison, as it is a sign that there was damage but it healed, and it could also refer to the healed areas where an addict used to inject themself.

Edgard Froese said this about the usage of William Blake’s poetry:

My interests in philosophy lead me to William Blake, whom I’ve admired for about 20 years as one of the greatest writers in the English language – apart from Shakespeare. I myself had a problem with Jocelyn during the recording. She’d already got through the texts, but during the session she took the book and smashed it on the floor, saying, ‘I’m an R & B singer and I don’t want to do this schoolkid bullshit!’ I still think she did a fairly good job, but she hated the lyrics, which are not easy to understand if you don’t know the background. It helps to know what Britain was all about when Blake wrote the story. It was an empire and his words were partly political, social and esoteric at the same time. If you don’t comprehend this then you may have a problem interpreting it correctly. Even my colleagues didn’t understand, so I don’t blame Jocelyn or anybody else. The recording session was very hard work, but it was my baby and I take full responsibility for that record.","June 10, 1987",1987

Written by Erasure members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, the heavily synthesized instrumentation is accentuated by acoustic guitar and Bell’s use of falsetto in the chorus.","September 19, 1988",1988

“Love to Hate You” is a 1991 song by English synth-pop duo Erasure. It was released as the second single from their fifth studio album, Chorus. Written by band members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, it is an electronic dance track clearly inspired by disco music. The synthesizer melody in the chorus is an interpolation of the string break from American singer Gloria Gaynor’s disco-era classic I Will Survive. The duo also recorded a Spanish version of the song, called “Amor y Odio” (Love and Hatred), and one in Italian called “Amo Odiarti”. The single was released by Mute Records in the UK and Sire Records in the US. It peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and became a Top 10 hit in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland and Sweden.

Critical reception
AllMusic editor Ned Raggett described the song as “supersassy”. Larry Flick from Billboard called it a “techno-conscious twirler”, that nicks an idea or two from Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive”. He complimented Andy Bell’s “sassy and soulful” performance as an interesting contrast to the track’s “overall electro tone”. The Daily Vault’s Michael R. Smith noted it as “an instant crowd pleaser of sorts”, adding that it “comes complete with live audience effects in the background.” Bill Wyman from Entertainment Weekly stated that the song “has a thumpy bottom and a passable hook.” Chris Gerard from Metro Weekly described it as “old-school disco with echoes of ""I Will Survive” in the verse and hints of ABBA as well. It’s a killer dance tune, but it’s just as good as a pop single. The vocal arrangement is clever, and the crowd noise during the big synth solos add to the excitement.“ Music & Media said it is a ""top rate pop/dance song, which draws influences from ‘70s Giorgio Moroder productions. The synthesizer outfit takes us to a lovely Caribbean bridge that will work as well on EHR as in clubland.” Music Week commented, “The instant familiarity” of “Love to Hate You” “is due in no small part to the fact that it seems to be based on several previous hits, most notably Gloria Gaynor’s I Will Survive, Elton John’s Nobody Wins and even Modern Romance’s Everybody Salsa. Typically throbbing Hi-NRG, subtle it is not, but a hit it most certainly is.” Darren Lee from The Quietus noted “the camp melodrama”, stating that it is one of “the most gloriously effervescent pop anthems ever recorded.” Mark Frith from Smash Hits wrote that “it’s rather nice to welcome Erasure back. With a tune that’s, erm, borrowing bits from certain '70s dance tunes, it’s a tale of life’s annoying Casanovas, and full of beans it is too.” Christopher Smith from TalkAboutPopMusic described it as “more early-80’s style electro pop and yet it felt so fresh in 1991.” He added, “This is one of those Erasure songs that you know word for word and are able to quote without fail at any concert where this is played.”

Chart performance
Love to Hate You is one of Erasure’s most successful singles on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number four. It became a top-ten hit in Greece, where it reached number nine; Finland, where it reached number seven; Austria, where it reached number six; Denmark and Ireland, where it reached number five; and Sweden, where it reached number four. In the US it reached number 17 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, number 10 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart, and number six on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.","September 9, 1991",1991

Someone criticized me once, and asked why we’d made ‘Roygbiv’ so short. For us, that is exactly how long it should be. It’s like that famous bit at the end of ‘Strawberry Fields’ by The Beatles, where you get the little voice at the end that says something like ‘I buried Paul,’ and it happens once, and it’s such a transitory thing that’s mixed in one ear really far away, but people went on and on about it for decades.

Showstopping, indelible and effusive—not to mention successful! It hit 11 in the UK and peaked at 7 in the US almost 2 years after its original release date. It also inspired Disclosure and Smith to collaborate again, with the two of them working together later on “Omen.”

British singer Sam Smith, who provides the vocals on the track, was initially hesitant to jump on the project. In an interview with KISS FM UK, they were quoted as saying:

I remember hearing “Latch” and I didn’t even know whether it was good or not, because I didn’t know electronic music or dance music. It just wasn’t for me.

Fortunately, despite their early inexperience, they took the opportunity and their career was launched.","October 4, 2012",2012

","Lorde joins Disclosure for a highly anticipated collaboration. “Magnets” was released two days before the release of  Disclosure’s sophomore album, Caracal.

Disclosure spoke about the collaboration in an interview with Pitchfork:

Well, we performed with her at the BRIT Awards and knew she was a really good singer. And she’s really nice as well, which is cool. When we had nearly finished the record, we got this call from her saying that she was in London and wanted to get in the studio, so we went in not really expecting anything. It was a quick process. That beat is more like a hip-hop beat than anything else, and we all liked it, so we just started writing—we didn’t have a board meeting at the start, like, “We’re gonna do this.”","September 23, 2015",2015

This is the third collaboration between the artists, with the first being the huge international hit, “Latch”, and the second being “Together”.

This catchy pop tune about a love-story gone wrong was premiered on July 27th, 2015. The release also included a music video which continues on from “Holding On”. It depicts a night of dancing interrupted by police units. The short film ended with the ominous words “to be continued”.

In an interview with Pitchfork, the brothers said the following about this track:

We’re really close with Sam and we share the same managers, so it wasn’t too hard in terms of linking up the date. As a guy, he’s not changed at all—he’s the same Sam that we met four years ago.

We’ve been fans of each other’s music for some time. We didn’t really know what he was like as a guy, but he turned out to be so safe and cool and chill—but not arrogant in any way. We wrote that song in Jungle Studios in New York, which is probably the coolest studio that we’ve ever been to. It has this panoramic view of Manhattan, so that informed the vibe.

In the EW interview Lawrence said:

The sun was going down and it was such a lovely vibe…and the vibe of driving around late and night, and it’s getting dark, and the beat’s pretty slow. Abel was loving it.

It was recorded by Patsy Cline and went to number two on the Billboard Country chart in 1962.  She initially hated the song, but her husband, Charlie Dick, convinced her to record it.

Crazy became her biggest hit, and it’s in the list of the 500 Greatest Country Songs.

Cline died in a plane crash in a plane crash near Camden, Tennessee on 5 March 1963.","October 16, 1961",1961

It’s worth noting that some historians claim Paul Rice actually wrote the tune and sold it to Davis.","November 25, 1989",1989

if i could start again
a million miles away
i would keep myself
i would find a way","This song, originally written and performed by Nine Inch Nails, is of disputed meaning: is it about self harm, doing heroin, or both? Either way, no matter if it reflects Cash’s addiction issues, or suicidal thoughts, it’s one of Cash’s classics. Johnny decided to change just one line, possibly reflecting his Christian faith.

The song was recommended to Cash by legendary producer, Rick Rubin, who produced Johnny Cash’s American series (and released them on his label American Recordings).  When Trent Reznor was asked if the song could be covered he said he was:

flattered [but worried that] the idea sounded a bit gimmicky.

However, after watching the video:

Wow. Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps… Wow. [I felt like] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn’t mine anymore… It really made me think about how powerful music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music in my bedroom as a way of staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [Somehow] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning — different, but every bit as pure.

The song was released as a single in March 2003, along with “Personal Jesus,” a Depeche Mode cover. It was the last single released by Cash before his death in September 2003. Cash saw it hit #33 on the Billboard “Alternative Songs” chart, and #56 on its Hot Country Charts, 48 years after his Cry! Cry! Cry! first hit the US Country chart.

 The music video becomes even more harrowing when one realises that June Carter Cash, Johnny’s wife, died only three months after it was made, and that the house it was filmed in (the Cash residence for 30 years) later burned down.","November 5, 2002",2002

the ring","Johnny Cash’s soon-to-be-second-wife June Carter wrote “Ring of Fire” in 1963 with Merle Kilgore to express the experience of falling in love with the married Man in Black.  Cash would continue to walk the line with his first wife, Vivian Liberto, until 1966.  June Carter finally became June Carter Cash in 1968.

After being originally recorded by June’s sister Anita Carter as “(Love’s) Ring of Fire”, the song was recorded by Cash on March 25, 1963.  It became the biggest hit of his career, staying at number one on the charts for seven weeks. It was certified Gold on January 21, 2010 by the R.I.A.A. and has also sold over 1.2 million digital downloads.



In 2002, shortly before his death, Cash sang another cover, “Hurt”; the perfect bookend to “Ring of Fire”. In it Cash acknowledges his failures as a husband and friend. If “Ring of Fire” was the first warning sign of an obsessive-compulsive personality, “Hurt” is the final apology.","March 25, 1963",1963

because youre mine i walk the line","One of his most famous songs, “I Walk the Line” is Johnny Cash’s promise to remain faithful to his first wife, Vivian, while he is on the road.  It seems a certain ring of fire interfered with this pledge.

The song became Cash’s first #1 Billboard hit. The single remained on the record charts for over 43 weeks, and sold over 2 million copies.



The title of the song was also used to name the Johnny Cash biopic film starring Joaquin Phoenix, and a Gregory Peck film.

This song’s influence on the music world is palpable. In his autobiography, Bob Dylan makes strong mention of its effect on him:

“I Walk the Line” [is] a song I’d always considered to be up there at the top, one of the most mysterious and revolutionary of all time, a song that makes an attack on your most vulnerable spots, sharp words from a master.
“I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.” Indeed. I must have recited those lines to myself a million times… When I first heard “I Walk the Line” so many years earlier, it sounded like a voice calling out, “What are you doing there, boy?” I was trying to keep my eyes wide opened, too.",April 1956,1956

In addition to being a #1 country hit in both the U.S. and Canada, it became an international crossover hit, charting in 6 different countries, and reaching the top 10 in both the UK and Ireland.

“Jolene” has been covered numerous times by major country, rock and pop artists. Most notable is The White Stripes‘ 2004 live cover, which reached the top 20 in the UK.

Rolling Stone named “Jolene” one of the “500 Greatest Songs of All Time”.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH3sQPtR_1Y&feature=youtu.be&

The song is about an tale of a woman confronting Jolene, a stunningly beautiful woman, who she believes is trying to steal away her lover and begging her “please don’t take my man.” Throughout the song, the woman implores Jolene “please don’t take him just because you can.” According to Parton, the song was inspired by a red-headed bank clerk who flirted with her husband Carl Dean at his local bank branch around the time they were newly married. In an interview, she also revealed that Jolene’s name and appearance are based on that of a young fan who came on stage for her autograph.",October 1973,1973

This song not only reached number one on the country charts, but also, in February 1981, reached number one on the pop and the adult-contemporary charts, giving her a triple-number-one hit. Parton became one of the few female country singers to have a number-one single on the country and pop charts simultaneously.

It also was a top 10 hit in Austria, Sweden, Belgium and New Zealand, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song, won two Grammys, and remains a workers' anthem. The basic rhythm pattern for the song was inspired by the sound that Parton’s fingernails make when rubbed together. In fact, they were recorded and featured in the song.

Sidenote: The Disney version of the performance gave some a very deluded and fanciful notion of the workplace, who only wish Minnie and Daisy had pink desks next to theirs. There are not nearly enough adorable musical numbers in my office!","November 10, 1980",1980

back through the years i go wandering once again
back to the seasons of my youth
i recall a box of rags that someone gave us
and how my mama put the rags to use

there were rags of many colors every piece was small
and i didnt have a coat and it was way down in the fall
mama sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love
she made my coat of many colors that i was so proud of

as she sewed she told a story from the bible she had read
about a coat of many colors joseph wore and then she said
perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness
and i just couldnt wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss

my coat of many colors that my mama made for me
made only from rags but i wore it so proudly
although we had no money i was rich as i could be
in my coat of many colors my mama made for me

so with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes
in my coat of many colors i hurried off to school
just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
in my coat of many colors my mama made for me
but they didnt understand it for i felt i was rich
and i told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch
and i told them all the story mama told me while she sewed
and how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes

but they didnt understand it and i tried to make them see
that one is only poor only if they choose to be
now i know we had no money but i was rich as i could be

Recorded on June 13, 1973, Parton wrote the song for her one-time partner and mentor Porter Wagoner, from whom she was professionally splitting at the time.

With “I Will Always Love You,” Parton became the first artist ever to earn a number one record twice with the same song as a singer, and three times as a writer. “I Will Always Love You” is the second song ever to reach the top three on the Billboard Hot 100 in separate chart runs. Parton also sang the song in the film The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.

Whitney Houston recorded a version of the song for the 1992 film The Bodyguard and it stayed on top of the Billboard Hot 100 for a then-record of 14 weeks. It became one of the best selling singles of all time, and it is widely misconstrued that Whitney Houston wrote the song.

While on an airplane flight, he was asked to write a song about ‘being on the road’ for the film by director Jerry Schatzberg and executive producer Sydney Pollack, so he grabbed a barf bag and proceeded to write “On The Road Again” on it.

oh daddy dont you worry none cause mamas got the pill","The Pill is Loretta Lynn’s ode to the freedoms and choices that the birth control pill (which was introduced in 1960) gave to women.



The song tells the story of a woman who has spent much of her married life pregnant – and she’s understandably a little bitter about it. However, now she’s got the pill, which gives her the ability to have as much sex as she’d like without risking yet another baby.

Though not strictly autobiographical, the song hints at Loretta’s life – she was the mother of six children, two of whom were born before she turned 19. Soon after the song came out, Lynn told People magazine:

If I’d had the pill back when I was havin’ babies I’d have taken ’em like popcorn. The pill is good for people. I wouldn’t trade my kids for anyone’s. But I wouldn’t necessarily have had six and I sure would have spaced ’em better.”

Though The Pill was timely, it was also controversial, especially for country music. Many radio stations banned the popular song, keeping it from reaching the top of the charts.","January 27, 1975",1975

loretta lynn,coal miner’s daughter,"well i was born the coal miners daughter
in a cabin on a hill in butcher holler
we were poor but we had love
thats the one thing that daddy made sure of
he shoveled coal to make a poor mans dollar
my daddy worked all night in the van lear coal mines
all day long in the field hoeing corn
mommy rocked the babies at night
and read the bible by the coaloil light
and everything would start all over come break of morn
daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miners pay
mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard every day
why ive seen her fingers bleed
to complain there was no need
shes smiled in mommys understanding way
in the summertime we didnt have shoes to wear
but in the wintertime wed all get a brand new pair
from a mailorder catalog
money made from selling a hog
daddy always managed to get the money somewhere
yeah im proud to be a coal miners daughter
i remember well the well where i drew water
the work we done was hard
at night wed sleep cause we were tired
i never thought of ever leaving butcher holler
well a lot of things have changed since wayback then
and its so good to be back home again
not much left but the floor
nothing lives here anymore
except the memories of a coal miners daughter",?,"October 5, 1970",1970
kenny rogers,the gambler,"
on a warm summers evenin on a train bound for nowhere
i met up with a gambler we were both too tired to sleep
so we took turns astarin out the window at the darkness
til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

he said ""son ive made a life out of readin peoples faces
and knowin what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
so if you dont mind my sayin i can see youre out of aces
for a taste of your whiskey ill give you some advice""

so i handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
and the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
said ""if youre gonna play the game boy
you gotta learn to play it right""

you got to know when to hold em know when to fold em
know when to walk away and know when to run
you never count your money when youre sittin at the table
therell be time enough for countin when the dealings done

every gambler knows that the secret to survivin
is knowin what to throw away and knowing what to keep
cause every hands a winner and every hands a loser
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep
and when he finished speakin
he turned back towards the window
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
and somewhere in the darkness the gambler he broke even
but in his final words i found an ace that i could keep

you got to know when to hold em know when to fold em
know when to walk away and know when to run
you never count your money when youre sittin at the table
therell be time enough for countin when the dealings done

you got to know when to hold em (when to hold em)
know when to fold em (when to fold em)
know when to walk away and know when to run
you never count your money when youre sittin at the table
therell be time enough for countin when the dealings done

know when to walk away and know when to run

kenny rogers,coward of the county,"
everyone considered him the coward of the county
hed never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
his mama named him tommy but folks just called him yellow
something always told me they were reading tommy wrong

he was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
i looked after tommy cause he was my brothers son
i still recall the final words my brother said to tommy
""son my life is over but yours has just begun""

promise me son not to do the things ive done
walk away from trouble if you can
now it dont mean youre weak if you turn the other cheek
i hope youre old enough to understand
son you dont have to fight to be a man

theres someone for everyone and tommys love was becky
in her arms he didnt have to prove he was a man
one day while he was working the gatlin boys came calling
they took turns at becky nthere was three of them
tommy opened up the door and saw his becky crying
the torn dress the shattered look was more than he could stand
he reached above the fireplace took down his daddys picture
as a tear fell on his daddys face he heard these words again
promise me son not to do the things ive done
walk away from trouble if you can
now it wont mean youre weak if you turn the other cheek
i hope youre old enough to understand
son you dont have to fight to be a man

the gatlin boys just laughed at him
when he walked into the barroom
one of them got up and met him half way cross the floor
tommy turned around they said ""hey look old yellas leavin""
but you couldve heard a pin drop
when tommy stopped and locked the door
twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
he wasnt holding nothing back he let em have it all
when tommy left the bar room not a gatlin boy was standing
he said ""this ones for becky"" as he watched the last one fall
n i heard him say

i promised you dad not to do the things youve done
i walk away from trouble when i can
now please dont think im weak i didnt turn the other cheek
and papa i sure hope you understand
sometimes you gotta fight when youre a man
everyone considered him the coward of the county","“Coward of the County” is a country song written by Roger Bowling and Billy Ed Wheeler, and recorded by American country music singer Kenny Rogers. It was released as the second single from the Triple Platinum album Kenny in late 1979.

A million-selling gold-certified 45, it is one of Rogers' biggest hits, topping the charts in Canada, Ireland and the UK. It also reached the top 20 in several more countries including a #3 peak in the US in early 1980.

A 95-minute film with the same story line and title as this song was released in late 1981.  In it, Tommy is a man who promised his father he’d be a pacifist but ends up breaking that promise after his wife is gang-raped. Rogers appears in the film as ‘Uncle Matthew’.","November 12, 1979",1979

The song peaked topped the Hot 100, Hot Country Singles and Adult Contemporary charts in the US in late 1980. It was also a top 30 hit in New Zealand, Belgium, The Netherlands and the UK.

In fact, the song was so successful that Richie has said, “I have an estate that ‘Lady’ bought”. Originally he wanted the song for himself, but his lawyer set him straight, telling him, “If you give it to Kenny, it will be bigger than you ever thought”. He was right!","September 29, 1980",1980

in a bar in toledo
across from the depot
on a bar stool she took off her ring
i thought id get closer
so i walked on over
i sat down and asked her name
when the drinks finally hit her
she said im no quitter
but i finally quit living on dreams
im hungry for laughter
and here ever after
im after whatever the other life brings
in the mirror i saw him
and i closely watched him
i thought how he looked out of place
he came to the woman
who sat there beside me
he had a strange look on his face
the big hands were calloused
he looked like a mountain
for a minute i thought i was dead
but he started shaking
his big heart was breaking
he turned to the woman and said

with four hungry children
and a crop in the field
ive had some bad times
lived through some sad times
but this time youre hurting wont heal

after he left us
i ordered more whiskey
i thought how shed made him look small
from the lights of the bar room
to a rented hotel room
we walked without talkin at all
she was a beauty
but when she came to me
she must have thought id lost my mind
i couldnt hold her
cuz the words that he told her
kept coming back time after time

It became Rogers' first major hit as a solo artist after leaving the successful country/rock group The First Edition the previous year. An international hit, it reached number 1 on the Billboard Country Singles chart and number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.

In the 1944 film Gaslight, a man makes his wife think she’s going crazy in part by dimming the gaslight in their home. Since then, the term “gaslighting” has been used to describe emotional manipulation designed to make someone doubt their own memory or perception. It’s likely that “gaslighter” in this context refers to Natalie Maines‘ ex-husband, Adrian Pasdar, with whom she had a public falling out.","March 4, 2020",2020

In the fall of 1990 Bruce Robison was working as a fry cook at an Austin diner and writing his first songs. That August, Iraq had invaded Kuwait, and the United States was preparing for a massive counterinvasion. Robison learned that one of his buddies at the diner, another fry cook, was being called up to active duty…and Robison found himself contemplating the unthinkable: dying young in war. Then he started writing about something even more unbearable: dying young while being in love. The first thing to come to him was a melody—the soaring opening of the chorus—and Robison shoehorned in some words: “I-I-I-I cried, never gonna hold the hand of another guy.” Details quickly followed: a lonely boy leaving for war after high school (Robison changed the setting to Vietnam), a shy girl (“a piccolo player in the marching band”) falling for him, the love between them growing even as they are thousands of miles apart. For the final verse, as the girl cries alone because her soldier has died, Robison recalled a familiar spot, the space beneath the stadium bleachers at Bandera High, where he had gone to school.

In 2003, with the United States again on the verge of war with Iraq, the Dixie Chicks took the song to number one on Billboard’s Hot Country Singles and Tracks chart.","July 26, 2002",2002

","“March March” is a punchy response to injustices and social issues in the US, and a promise to follow the activists leading the country toward positive change. Dissecting issues like school shootings, climate change, gun control, reproductive justice, and racial justice, and The Chicks promise to use their platform as prominent singers and advance the cause for justice.

The official music video affirms the group’s stance on social issues in the US. It contains imagery from civil rights and pride marches, and nods to Black Lives Matter and #SayHerName, a movement dedicated to recognizing the anti-Black and police brutality violence that Black women face. It also confirms the group’s stance on political activism. They spoke out and received backlash in 2003. They’ll continue to do so now, and with a louder voice.

March March is entirely, overtly and unapologetically political: and it reminds us that it’s essential to get involved politically. The Chicks don’t care if their opinions lose them friends – they march  to their own drum.","June 25, 2020",2020

","Controversy erupted over the Dixie Chicks in 2003 following a critical comment vocalist Natalie Maines made of the American President George W. Bush while performing in a concert in London, United Kingdom. In relation to the forthcoming invasion of Iraq, Maines said, “…we don’t want this war, this violence, and we’re ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas.”

Taking the Long Way was the first studio album released by the Dixie Chicks after that. The controversy, and the band’s reaction to it, is the major theme of some of the songs in the album, including “Not Ready to Make Nice”. The song, which was written by all three band members along with Dan Wilson, is a statement of how they feel over the controversy, the banning of their songs from country music radio stations, and freedom of speech.

The song was The Chick’s first and only song to become Double Platinum. Although it hit No. 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100, it only reached No. 36 on the country charts, highlighting a disparity between Country and Pop music and their reaction to the 2003 controversy.

In an interview about the new album, Maines explained,

This album was therapy. To write these songs allowed me to find peace with everything and move on.”","March 24, 2006",2006

The song notably features Kix Brooks on lead vocals instead of Ronnie Dunn.  It’s Kix’s only lead vocals single to reach #1 on the charts.

The song tells the story of a man who has been mistreated by the woman he is in love with. He admits that he still loves her, will always love her, but has to make the difficult decision to walk away because he knows he cannot trust her with his feelings. The conceit of his leaving her, and also the song’s title, is a reminder that she is the one who’s going to miss him.

Billboard’s Eric Boehler said of the song:

another welcome Brooks & Dunn outing.

… and the magazine’s Deborah Evans Price called it an “excellent song craftsmanship with great production.”","June 12, 1995",1995

Ronnie Dunn sings lead vocals on this track, recounting the nostalgic memories he’s associated with the red dirt road of his youth in Alabama, where iron deposits in the ground give the soil a ruddy hue.

The narrative arc tells of a rural boy who grows up, leaves town, loses his way in vices like booze and fast cars, then finds himself again in the love of his boyhood sweetheart and his lord, Jesus.

Brooks and Dunn performed the song at NASCAR legend and B&D collaborator Dale Earnhardt’s tribute concert at the Daytona International Speedway in the summer of 2003.

As the third single from 2005’s Some Hearts, the track became the first country song in history to sell over two million digital copies, and won two Grammy awards, for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and Best Country Song. Since its release, it has been certified five times platinum by the RIAA, selling five million copies.","August 19, 2006",2006
carrie underwood,cry pretty,"
im sorry but im just a girl
not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
im pretty good at keepin it together
i hold my composure for worse or for better
so i apologize if you dont like what you see
but sometimes my emotions get the best of me
and falling apart is as human as it gets
you cant hide it you cant fight what the truth is

you can pretty lie and say its okay
you can pretty smile and just walk away
pretty much fake your way through anything
but you cant cry pretty

oh no you can’t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
it dont matter if youre in a crowd or home all alone
yeah its all the same when youre looking in the mirror
a picture of pain so let it flow like a river

you can pretty lie and say its okay
you can pretty smile and just walk away
pretty much fake your way through anything
but you cant cry pretty
you cant turn off the flood when the dam breaks
when all your mascara is going to waste
when things get ugly you just gotta face
that you cant cry pretty

oh no you cant
ooh yeah

you cant turn off the flood when the dam breaks
when all your mascara is going to waste
when things get ugly you just gotta face
that you cant cry pretty

yeah yeah yeah yeah
no you cant cry
no you cant cry

no no no no no no no no woo
you cant cry
you cant cry pretty baby
oh yeah woo woo
no you cant cry pretty yeah","This song follows Underwood’s journey of coming to terms with herself and her difference of appearance after an accident. She fell on the steps of her home and had to receive 40-50 stitches on her face.

In “Cry Pretty”, she exposes her vulnerability and insecurities and gives power to them, empowering and enabling others to feel comfortable doing the same. She tells listeners to join her in embracing their emotions even when they aren’t “pretty”. It is common for people in this society both men and women, to suppress their emotions because they feel they will be viewed as weak or ugly if seen crying or under turmoil. She sends a message to those fans about how unrealistic it is for them to expect to be able to maintain an attractive appearance when going through distress and to embrace how they look. This song promotes healthy expectations, body love, anti-shame and general acceptance.","April 11, 2018",2018

Carrie Underwood’s Instagram page also posted a clip previewing the song:



The first collaboration between 7-times Grammy Winner/Country superstar Carrie Underwood and rapper Ludacris leaked two days before its official release which was set for Friday January 12th.

Underwood has not released a solo single since she dropped “Dirty Laundry” from her 2015 album Storyteller back in September 2016. Her most recent collaboration was “The Fighter”  duet released in February 2017 and featured on Keith Urban’s Grammy-nominated Ripcord album.

The song will also be the first new music Carrie releases since revealing facial injuries caused after falling outside her Nashville home back in November 2017. She also revealed that the accident was much more serious than originally thought, resulting in “between 40 and 50 stitches” to her face.","January 12, 2018",2018

a love supreme","“Acknowledgement,” as the beginning phase of the A Love Supreme suite, instrumentally deals with a person’s first introduction to the theme of love: recognizing the presence of one’s future lover. Additionally, Coltrane’s slow repetition of the album title, towards the end of the track, adds on to the idea of being verbally recognized. Thus, this is one of Coltrane’s only tracks in his entire discography to contain spoken words, let alone in the entire A Love Supreme album.

The track opens with a gong and a short cymbal solo accompanied by Coltrane’s light-hearted saxophone, best capturing the idea of “love at first sight.” It then shifts into a more calm sound as the bass slowly and ominously repeats itself if perhaps imitating the phrase, “a love supreme,” similar to Coltrane’s vocal passage at the track’s closure. The bass is then joined in by the saxophone, piano, and percussion as a recreation of the mysterious but relaxing mood of experiencing deep affection from a significant other.

“Acknowledgement” is among one of Coltrane’s more popular jazz pieces and offers a portal into the saxophonist’s illustrious, magnificent magnum opus that revolves around a quite unique theme.","January 1, 1965",1965

It features vocals from singer-songwriter Halsey and Chainsmokers member Andrew Taggart, marking the first time the Chainsmokers feature their vocals on a track—Taggart previously performed backing vocals for the chorus of “Roses”. It is also their first collaboration with Halsey.

At the 2016 MTV VMAs, both the duo and Halsey performed “Closer”. The duo teased the performance as “new level” on Twitter. This was the second time that “Closer” was performed at Madison Square Garden — the first being at Halsey’s sold-out Badlands Tour show on August 13th, 2016 where The Chainsmokers performed as guests.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agFMqNB9BYM

In September 2016, after “Closer” had already reached the summit of the Billboard Hot 100, Isaac Slade and Joe King, respectively the lead singer and guitarist of The Fray, were given additional songwriting credits on the song due to the similarity of its chorus to the verses of their 2005 breakout hit, “Over My Head (Cable Car).”

On the March-25-dated chart, “Closer” tied LeAnn Rimes Cibrian’s 32 week record in the Billboard Hot 100 top 10. The singer held it for 20 years – beginning December 13, 1997 – with her single “How Do I Live.” She congratulated the hitmaker duo on Twitter by singing a mashup of “Closer” and her own song.

On September 15, 2018, the song was certified Diamond by the RCAA, verifying that the song had sold an equivalent ten million units in the United States alone.

The Chainsmokers tweeted this prior to the release of the track:



The song features uncredited vocals from accomplished New York City singer-songwriter Emily Warren, and is the first original song of 2017 by The Chainsmokers, following a breakout year in 2016.

Warren’s involvement on the track was confirmed by The Chainsmokers' manager Adam Alpert to Billboard. The Chainsmokers hinted at Warren’s involvement in a tweet, and Warren also posted a video on Instagram saying it’s her vocals in the description. A followup interview with Billboard confirmed Warren as the mysterious female vocalist.

The song was first previewed in late December 2016 live appearances at SnowGlobe and the LACC. The Chainsmokers officially teased and verified the song through Facebook in early January 2017. The song was released on January 13, 2017.

The song made its official TV debut on SNL on April 8th 2017. The duo also performed their song, “Break Up Every Night” on the show.","January 13, 2017",2017

The song features vocals from LA-based singer-songwriter Phoebe Ryan, and is the fourth original song released in 2016 by The Chainsmokers, following the success of their #1 hit, “Closer.”

After previewing the song at various live appearances in late August, The Chainsmokers confirmed the song would be their next single in early September 2016. Phoebe Ryan teased it on her Twitter four days before and the YouTube audio was released one day before the song’s official release on September 30th.","September 30, 2016",2016

This song represents an inherent change in the right direction not the beginning, but the end of that transition – almost like we have finally come full circle to a place musically we are finally completely happy with a song … That is not just a reflection us personally but also a reflection of us currently. That isn’t to say we won’t continue to evolve and take chances and the music will all sound the same, but this to us felt as natural as drinking the bottle of Patron every show.

the grateful dead,terrapin station,"lady with a fan
let my inspiration flow
in token rhyme suggesting rhythm
that will not forsake me
till my tale is told and done
while the firelights aglow
strange shadows from the flames will grow
till things weve never seen
will seem familiar
shadows of a sailor forming
winds both foul and fair all swarm
down in carlisle he loved a lady
many years ago
here beside him stands a man
a soldier from the looks of him
who came through many fights
but lost at love
while the storyteller speaks
a door within the fire creaks
suddenly flies open
and a girl is standing there
eyes alight with glowing hair
all that fancy paints as fair
she takes her fan and throws it
in the lions den
""which of you to gain me tell
will risk uncertain pains of hell
i will not forgive you
if you will not take the chance""
the sailor gave at least a try
the soldier being much too wise
strategy was his strength
and not disaster
the sailor coming out again
the lady fairly leapt at him
thats how it stands today
you decide if he was wise
the storyteller makes no choice
soon you will not hear his voice
his job is to shed light
and not to master
since the end is never told
we pay the teller off in gold
in hopes he will come back
but he cannot be bought or sold
terrapin station
inspiration move me brightly
light the song with sense and color
hold away despair
more than this i will not ask
faced with mysteries dark and vast
statements just seem vain at last
some rise some fall some climb
to get to terrapin
counting stars by candlelight
all are dim but one is bright
the spiral light of venus
rising first and shining best
(oh)
from the northwest corner
of a brandnew crescent moon
crickets and cicadas sing
a rare and different tune
terrapin station
in the shadow of the moon
terrapin station
and i know well be there soon
terrapin  i cant figure out
terrapin  if its the end or beginning
terrapin  but the trains put its brakes on
and the whistle is screaming terrapin
at a siding
while you were gone
these faces filled with darkness
the obvious was hidden
with nothing to believe in
the compass always points to terrapin
sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
youre back in terrapin for good or ill again
for good or ill again","“Terrapin Part 1” is a track broken up into seven sections: Lady with a Fan, Terrapin Station, Terrapin, At a Siding, Terrapin Flyer, and Refrain. “Terrapin Station” was released as the B-side to the album’s second single, “Passenger.”

“Terrapin” is one of the Dead’s greatest products of simultaneous inspiration. It is a modest symphony that builds into a stunningly powerful love story involving a competition between a cautious soldier and a reckless sailor for the attention of the lady with the fan.



Terrapin is perhaps a poetic tribute to Gary Snyder’s Turtle Island. In that regard, the song serves as a tribute to the hard and bloody journey to a promised land of romantic dreams.

The song was performed around 300 times from 1977 to the end of their career, with the most complete performance from Winterland Arena in early 1977, which included Terrapin Transit. This specific performance is from March 18th, 1977 and can be listened to here. Terrapin Transit is incorrectly labeled as “Alhambra.”","July 27, 1977",1977
the grateful dead,ripple,"
if my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
and my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
would you hear my voice come through the music
would you hold it near as it were your own

its a handmedown the thoughts are broken
perhaps theyre better left unsung
i dont know dont really care
let there be songs to fill the air

ripple in still water
when there is no pebble tossed
nor wind to blow

reach out your hand if your cup be empty
if your cup is full may it be again
let it be known there is a fountain
that was not made by the hands of men

there is a road no simple highway
between the dawn and the dark of night
and if you go no one may follow
that path is for your steps alone
ripple in still water
when there is no pebble tossed
nor wind to blow

you who choose to lead must follow
but if you fall you fall alone
if you should stand then whos to guide you
if i knew the way i would take you home","“Ripple” is the sixth song on the Grateful Dead album American Beauty. It was released as the B-side to the single “Truckin'”.

Robert Hunter wrote this song in 1970 in London in the same afternoon he wrote “Brokedown Palace” and “To Lay Me Down” (reputedly also drinking half a bottle of retsina in the process).

The song debuted August 18, 1970 at Fillmore West in San Francisco. Jerry Garcia wrote the music to this song.","November 1, 1970",1970
the grateful dead,scarlet begonias,"as i was walking round grosvenor square
not a chill to the winter
but a nip to the air
from the other direction
she was calling my eye
it could be an illusion
but i might as well try
might as well try
she had rings on her fingers and
bells on her shoes
and i knew without asking she was
into the blues
she wore scarlet begonias
tucked into her curls
i knew right away
she was not like other girls
other girls
in the thick of the evening
when the dealing got rough
she was too pat to open
and too cool to bluff
as i picked up my matches and
was closing the door
i had one of those flashes
id been there before
been there before
i aint often right
but ive never been wrong
it seldom turns out the way
it does in the song
once in a while
you get shown the light
in the strangest of places
if you look at it right
well there aint nothing wrong
with the way she moves
or scarlet begonias or a
touch of the blues
and theres nothing wrong with
the look thats in her eye
i had to learn the hard way
to let her pass by
let her pass by
the wind in the willows played tea for two
the sky was yellow and the sun was blue
strangers stopping strangers
just to shake their hand
everybodys playing
in the heart of gold band
heart of gold band","“Scarlet Begonias” is the stand-out masterpiece of 1974’s From the Mars Hotel. The song has a Caribbean feel that Garcia would later relate to Paul Simon’s “Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard.” An acoustic song done electronically, Hunter wrote the lyrics – which echo the British nursery rhyme “Ride a Cock Horse to Banbury Cross” – while living in England. Whether his references are meant to allude to Queen Elizabeth or Lady Godiva, the lady with the flowers was one of Hunter’s most exquisitely romantic objects of desire, a quest destined to fail.



The live debut of “Scarlet Begonias” came on March 23, 1974 at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California. This concert was later released partially on Dick’s Picks Vol. 24","June 27, 1974",1974

The main theme of the song is that a life of crime always sticks with you. That is to say, once you deal with the devil you will always deal with the devil. The song goes on to talk about all the measures the narrator must take and all the things that he (I assume it is a he) must endure/misses due to his life of crime.

The song was originally written by Robert Hunter for the New Riders of the Purple Sage, and was written along with NRPS’s John Dawson.","November 1, 1970",1970

The singer eagerly looks up into the sky through a telescope/binoculars to catch a glimpse at a U.F.O. carrying Jesus.

This song may be inspired by the Miracle of the Sun, an event in 1917 where hundreds of eye witnesses in Portugal reported seeing the sun dancing and zig-zagging through the sky. The “miracle” was attributed to the Virgin Mary.

DOOM explains in XXL Magazine:

[This song was] a while ago, so I’m trying to remember what inspired it. It’s really just normally what I’d be talking about. I kinda do bragging rap. I do the kind of hip-hop where the MC is more pointing out things and accentuating certain things that have been forgotten at some stage. So I’m really just explaining hip-hop rules. Rules about rhyming. Typical shit that you would normally do or don’t do. That’s basically it. Hold on a second, I’m crossing the street right now.

The beat was later released in his Special Herbs beat tapes. The beat is titled “Saffron” and it is on Special Herbs Vol. 2

(""we need food"")","“Beef Rapp,” the first track off of MM.. Food.
Written and produced by MF DOOM, (a.k.a. Metal Fingers when he’s producing).

This ditty here is about those rappers who make their living from “beef raps,” fights started with other rappers to boost sales. Battle raps are a true part of Hip Hop, and true battles are things of legend (e.g. MC Shan vs. KRS-One, LL Cool J vs. Kool Moe D, Hammer, Ice-T and Canibus, etc.). DOOM doesn’t care too much for it though, as he explains in XXL Magazine:


Oh yeah, “Beef Rapp.”[sic] Good song. Good choice. I just think it’s a funny word. I don’t get angry at this point, so [rap beef] is like whatever. The challenge is what it’s about with me, the challenge of being such a picky topic to handle. Also, the double entendre with the word beef, the way it’s perceived in the street world and it’s a food—a so-called food—so how it’s perceived in the nutritional realm. The fact that there’s two things that correlate there gave me enough metaphors to play with. But it’s all fun. I always do it with something that’s fun. Anger is something I don’t deal with.

It had to be two things: It had to be a food people could relate to and there had to be another play on the word. For instance, I’d say kon queso, like cheese. Everyone knows “cheese” has a reference in the street, as money and whatnot. And cheese is something that’s always added in addition to a cheeseburger or a beef patty. So it’s about finding a word where you can take two different approaches to it.","September 2, 2003",2003

The instrumental contains a sample of Galt MacDermot’s “Princess Gika”, off Woman Is Sweeter soundtrack. The sample was suggested to DOOM by then general manager of Stones Throw Records, Egon, who is a great crate digger. The instrumental had previously been released as the song “Styrax Gum,” off DOOM’s collection of beats, Special Herbs.","March 24, 2009",2009

i said ""hello pretty mama its your lover man""
she said ""baby come on over as quick as you can""
i said ""i cant come now someones comin to get me""
then she said ""im all alone theres nobody with me""
thought for a second ""oh shit shes alone""
then i was knockin at her door fore she hung up the phone
she let me in the house and gave me a kiss
and said ""give me that thing that you know i missed""
and so we went into her room and we got high
but she couldnt keep her hand from off my fly
so i made her lock the door went to check it
when i came back in the girl was naked
that was my cue to do the do
i took my clothes off and started on the pooh

she said ""caz somebodys comin""
i said ""yeah me""
then the door bust open and there was her folks
i thought ""damn they coulda waited  said damn they coulda waited said damn they coulda waited til i finished my strokes""
her mother was in shock her father reached on the shelf
pulled down a 45 i almost shit on myself

enjoy the silence","“Enjoy The Silence” is Depeche Mode’s highest charting song in the US and one of several top ten hits in their homeland the UK. It won “Best British Single” at the 1991 Brit Awards.

In 2010, Pitchfork placed it at #15 on their Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s. Rolling Stone described it as “sensually serene”

Vocalist Dave Gahan explained that “Enjoy The Silence” began as a “very slow, ballad-y couple of verses” but bandmate Alan Wilder and producer Flood converted it into the danceable new wave hit it became. At first, songwriter Martin Gore was initially not on board with the uptempo rewrite.

I thought the very nature of the song was, you know, enjoy the silence, so it ought to have a very serene atmosphere. It took me a while to get used to the idea, but as we took it further that way with the guitar riff, it really pulled together.","February 5, 1990",1990

It also reached the top 20 in several countries overseas and became Warner Bros. Records' biggest-selling 12"" single in its 40+ year history. Rolling Stone later named “Personal Jesus” as one of the 500 greatest songs of all time in 2011.

According to vocalist Dave Gahan, Priscilla Presley calls her husband Elvis “her own personal Jesus” in her book Elvis & Me and that is what inspired songwriter Martin Gore to write this song. Gore confirms the track was inspired by Priscilla Presley’s idolatry of her husband. Taking the lyrics literally, “Personal Jesus” is about a person who offers relief through a second-rate confessional via the telephone.","March 19, 1990",1990

Rolling Stone described the track as “otherworldly and bluesy”. NPR felt the song pairs “seductive pop hooks with darkly romantic content.”

As of May 2017, “Policy Of Truth” is only Depeche Mode single to do better in the US than the UK.

Lyrically, its theme is: once you have confessed to a wrongdoing, you can’t take it back, and have to suffer the consequences.","March 19, 1990",1990

The song is produced by Simian Mobile Disco’s James Ford but it maintains Depeche Mode’s signature sound.

It is not the first time Depeche Mode touch political themes in their songs. ‘Everything Counts’, ‘Get The Balance Right’, ‘People Are People’, ‘Master And Servant’, ‘New Dress’ are all political songs.

The theme of the song brings back the more political side of the band and it encourages people to start a revolution.



You can sense a kind of deception in the song lyrics as Dave goes on describing all the things we (as a society) are suffering and how we haven’t done anything yet.

Dave Gahan revealed on Rolling Stone that Martin L. Gore’s is beign sarcastic on the song:

Martin wrote it in a very sarcastic, English way","February 3, 2017",2017

and i was thinkin on the drive down ""any time now
hes gonna say its love"" you never called it what it was
til we were dead and gone and buried
check the pulse and come back swearin its the same
after three months in the grave
and then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you
but all i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
and i know its long gone and
there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough
to forget why i needed to

cause there we are again in the middle of the night
were dancin round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs i was there
i remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but i kept you like an oath
sacred prayer and wed swear
to remember it all too well yeah

well maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up
runnin scared i was there
i remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of bein honest
im a crumpledup piece of paper lyin here
cause i remember it all all all
they say alls well that ends well but im in a new hell
every time you doublecross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it wouldve been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a neverneedy everlovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
not weepin in a party bathroom
some actress askin me what happened you
thats what happened you
you who charmed my dad with selfeffacing jokes
sippin coffee like youre on a latenight show
but then he watched me watch the front door all night willin you to come
and he said ""its supposed to be fun turning twentyone""

time wont fly its like im paralyzed by it
id like to be my old self again but im still tryin to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you cant get rid of it
cause you remember it all too well yeah

cause there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
it was rare i was there
i remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare i was there
i remember it all too well
and i was never good at tellin jokes but the punch line goes
""ill get older but your lovers stay my age""
from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones
im a soldier whos returning half her weight
and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue
just between us did the love affair maim you too
cause in this citys barren cold
i still remember the first fall of snow
and how it glistened as it fell
i remember it all too well

just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us i remember it (just between us) all too well
wind in my hair i was there i was there (i was there)
down the stairs i was there i was there
sacred prayer i was there i was there
it was rare you remember it all too well

it was rare you remember it
wind in my hair i was there i was there
down the stairs i was there i was there
sacred prayer i was there i was there
it was rare you remember it","Widely regarded as one of Swift’s best songs, “All Too Well” sees her picking up shards of memories after a gut-wrenching breakup. She jumps through time to reflect on her best and worst memories with her ex, making the listener feel as though they were there with the couple.

Swift told Pop Dust that she began writing the song in a soundcheck for her 2011 tour in support of Speak Now. Co-writer Liz Rose explained that the song was initially 10-15 minutes long before she helped Swift pare it down, and Swift shared some of the original lyrics in a deluxe edition of her 2019 album, Lover.

Melodically, this version of “All Too Well” is more subdued than the version we hear on the album. This change is evident throughout the song. This version begins with a saccharine melody before building up to a steady drum beat, while the original is heavily backed by guitar.

Lyrically, the songs are also different. This ten minute version is more vitriolic and bitter, while the album version is bittersweet. The metaphors in Verse 2 are reminiscent of folklore/evermore era Taylor, rather than Red era, with comparisons to bolder themes like death and tragedy rather than just the specific memories present in the original.

Many believe Swift took inspiration from her relationship with actor Jake Gyllenhaal — the secret message “Maple Lattes” is hidden in the song’s liner notes, and the two shared those coffees in November 2010. In a 2015 interview with Howard Stern, Gyllenhaal claimed to not know that Swift wrote a song about him, though she seemingly told Vulture he reached out to her after hearing the album.

“All Too Well” was the fourth song to contribute to Swift’s “Track Five pattern,” a pattern fans have noted where she puts one of the most emotive songs on an album as the fifth track. Previous examples were “Cold As You,” “White Horse,” and “Dear John.”

As a tribute to her fans and the massive impact this song had on her personal and professional life, Swift wrote and produced a short film for the song, starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien.","November 12, 2021",2021

Its music video — which was written and directed by Taylor and shot during the COVID-19 pandemic — finds Taylor shifting through different places by the magic of playing the piano. She revealed in a Tweet that everyone who was on-set took extra precautions to prevent the spread of the virus:

The entire shoot was overseen by a medical inspector, everyone wore masks, stayed away from each other, and I even did my own hair, makeup, and styling.

“cardigan” is believed to be the first part of folklore’s “Teenage Love Triangle,” told from the point of view of Betty. The storyline is followed by “august” and “betty.” Swift explained in a livechat the night of folklore’s release:

There’s a collection of three songs I refer to as The Teenage Love Triangle. These three songs explore a love triangle from all three people’s perspectives at different times in their lives.","July 24, 2020",2020

ah ah","“exile” describes two ex-lovers seeing each other following a break-up. Justin Vernon describes feelings of confusion about how quickly a lover moved on, while Swift offers a perspective about repeated warning signs that the relationship was no longer working. It’s also worth noting the contrast between Vernon’s rougher voice and Swift’s smoother one, which mirrors the contrast between their views of the relationship.

The song prompted many comparisons to Swift’s 2012 track “The Last Time,” another song that discusses the downfall of a relationship. Much like “exile,” Swift and featured artist Gary Lightbody’s voices contrast in tone, highlighting their differences.

“exile” is one of many folklore songs to contain a movie motif — other songs to do so include “the 1,” “this is me trying,” and “hoax.” It’s also her first collaboration with Bon Iver, who she called one of her “musical heroes” in an Instagram post announcing folklore.","July 24, 2020",2020

The interviewer described the song as a “romantic, haunting, waltzy, singer-songwritery nugget.” Swift announced the song’s release date during an acceptance speech at the 2019 Teen Choice Awards. Three days later, the song appeared on iTunes, revealing that it’s the third track on the album.

The song is a romantic track dedicated to Swift’s partner of three years, Joe Alwyn. It takes a wedding-like perspective on their relationship and shares information about their romance. A Twitter user who attended one of the secret sessions alleged that “‘Lover’ is Taylor’s favorite [original] song of all time,” having asked her directly during a Q&A.

On the day of its release, “Lover” reached number #1 on the US iTunes charts, making it her 35th song to do so. With this milestone, she extends her record as the female with the most #1 singles in iTunes' history.

The music video for the song was released on August 22, 2019, immediately following Swift’s Lover’s Lounge on YouTube. It features Swift and her love interest in a house inside a snow globe, illustrating the ups and downs of a relationship in progress. During Swift’s livestream, she further revealed that the concept for the music video originated from a lyric in her 1989 song, “You Are In Love”:

what the","“Swish Swish” is the third single from Katy Perry’s fifth studio album, Witness and marks the first song featuring vocals from both Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj. It is a self-empowerment anthem that calls out haters. Katy has mentioned that her album is about a “360° liberation” and this song is about escaping pointless negativity. The central hook uses the image of a basketball player consistently scoring points, imitating the ‘swish’ sound of the hoop’s net.

Fans speculated the song to be a response to Taylor Swift’s 2014 hit “Bad Blood,” citing many lyrical references.

This was later confirmed when she starred in James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke interview. Katy explained:

She started it and it’s time for her to finish it. Now, there is the law of cause and effect. You do something, there’s going to be a reaction, and trust me, daddy, there’s going to be a reaction.

The song was indirectly confirmed days prior by EDM artist and ex-Taylor flame Calvin Harris, who said he “wasn’t involved” in a now-deleted tweet.","May 19, 2017",2017

Perry described the song itself as “purposeful pop” on her Twitter. The song features Skip Marley, the grandson of Bob Marley.

The release culminates a guerrilla marketing effort in which disco balls with headphone jacks were strategically placed in cities around the world. Fans who hunted them down got to listen to “Chained to the Rhythm” before its official debut, including us.

The song was performed live for the first time at the 2017 Grammy Awards.

The official music video was released on February 21st, 2017. The video is directed by Mathew Cullen and shows Katy visiting a futuristic theme park called ‘Oblivia’.","February 10, 2017",2017

On the summery dance-pop track, Perry boasts about her efforts to fulfill a lover’s sexual appetites. The track contains many food-related sexual innuendos. During her appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Perry said the song represented “sexual liberation”.

Perry hinted the release of the song by emailing fans a recipe for the “World’s Best Cherry Pie”.

When asked about “Creep” in 1993, Yorke said:

I have a real problem being a man in the ‘90s… Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you’re in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do… It comes back to the music we write, which is not effeminate, but it’s not brutal in its arrogance. It is one of the things I’m always trying: To assert a sexual persona and on the other hand trying desperately to negate it.

Jonny Greenwood said the song was in fact a happy song about “recognizing what you are”.

Notable covers include those by The Pretenders, Carrie Manolakos, Macy Gray, Lea Michele and Dean Geyer, as part of Glee, Vega Choir, Prince, The Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps, and most recently, Kimberly Nichole, who performed a very strong cover of this song on the 2015 season of The Voice.

Despite, or perhaps because of, the popularity of the song, Radiohead grew to hate “Creep” and have rarely played it live since the OK Computer tour. “My Iron Lung”, written in 1994 and later released on The Bends, is about the song.","September 21, 1992",1992

i lost myself i lost myself
phew for a minute there
i lost myself i lost myself","One of several stunning singles from Radiohead’s heavily influential masterpiece, OK Computer, “Karma Police” is a haunting and atmospheric track. Thom Yorke’s strained, lackadaisical vocals are at once warm and sinister, echoing the delusions of an addict in the midst of a narcotic meltdown. Musically, the band follows a creamy, dreamlike chord progression that makes use of an old Beatles melody, laid out on the piano to create a velvety bed of uneasy comfort.","May 21, 1997",1997

“We did endless versions afterwards […] and they were all just covers of the first version. So we gave up and went back to [the original].”","May 21, 1997",1997

The song’s lyrics tie in with a number of themes common in OK Computer, including insanity, violence, slogans, and political objection to capitalism.

Yorke’s lyrics were based on an unpleasant experience at a Los Angeles bar during which he was surrounded by strangers high on cocaine. In particular, Yorke was frightened by a woman who became violent after someone spilled a drink on her.

The woman inspired the line “kicking squealing Gucci little piggy” in the song’s second section. Yorke described her as “inhuman”, and said

[…]there was a look in this woman’s eyes that I’d never seen before anywhere… Couldn’t sleep that night because of it.

In an issue of Rolling Stone, the band has compared the song to other multi-part rock pieces by famous artists, and tackled the often-raised comparison with progressive rock. Thom Yorke:

It was 50 percent “Bohemian rhapsody,” if I could ever get that many vocals together, and 50 percent “Happiness Is a Warm Gun.”

Ed O'Brien:

To me, the song sounded like Queen meets the Pixies. […] People thought it was prog, but prog always took itself so seriously. And “Paranoid Android,” there’s a kind of serious message in there, but it’s kind of cartoon-like.

Jonny Greenwood:

There’s a Mellotron on it. I remember hearing a Genesis record and thinking the Mellotron sounded amazing, so I stole it. It was either “Nursery Cryme  or ”Selling England by the Pound“. It didn’t sound like any other keyboard. Instead there was a choir, and a weird, fucked-up sort of choir. I love the fact that the notes run out after a few seconds. Some relative of the inventor was trying to remake them and had a few. They came with the tapes in and it turned out they all belonged to Tangerine Dream, which is getting into prog territory.

The song was also used as the ending theme for the anime series Ergo Proxy.","May 21, 1997",1997

Its official release was first teased by Eilish’s brother (who also produced this track as well as many other Eilish songs), Finneas, on Twitter:

https://twitter.com/finneasoconnell/status/1051163190250196992?s=21

Eilish later shared the official release in an Instagram post. In a later Instagram story, Eilish also confirmed the release of a music video in addition to the Spotify Vertical Video, saying:

you are not even READY for the official video

The video, released on October 25th, 2018, was inspired by fan artwork. It features Eilish crying thick, inky black tears, and reached #1 on YouTube trending in several countries, including the US.

The song was first performed live on the 30th of January 2018 at The Tuning Fork in Auckland, New Zealand, and stayed in the setlist of the singer’s second tour, the “Where’s My Mind Tour.”","October 17, 2018",2018

It was first proven to exist after Eilish teased a snippet of the track on her Instagram story.

In an interview with PopBuzz, Eilish referred to the track, stating she knew from the beginning that “bad guy” would open the album.

On the same day as the album’s release, the official music video was uploaded to YouTube. The beginning of the video also contains “!!!!!!!”, the intro of WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?. Billie confirmed that the song would be receiving a music video with a comment on Instagram under a fan post.

On August 19th, the song reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 making her the first person born in the 21st century to have a #1 and dethroning Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road”, who held the #1 spot for 19 consecutive weeks. Lil Nas X congratulated Billie on her achievement through a tweet:

The lyrics showcase Billie’s strong relationship with her brother FINNEAS, as he’s the one she goes to for support when dealing with these types of problems.

The song is Billie Eilish’s first single released after her debut album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?. The song was announced on November 11, 2019 via Twitter and Instagram stories. It had also been previously teased via Twitter on November 5th, 2019. On November 12, 2019, one day before its release, Eilish teased a 12-second snippet of the track via Instagram. A year before the track’s release, an eight second instrumental clip of “everything i wanted” could be heard in the background of one of Eilish’s Instagram stories.","November 13, 2019",2019

In a February 2021 interview on Billie’s documentary,  The World’s a Little Blurry, the film’s director, RJ Cutler, hinted that the unreleased songs that appeared in the documentary may end up on Billie’s album:

It marks the end of Imagine Dragons' self-imposed hiatus that started in 2016. The song acts as the title for their documentary surrounding LGBT youth and the Mormon church.

The song was released on the first of February as the lead single for their third studio album, Evolve, and was featured in a commercial for the Nintendo Switch that premiered on Super Bowl LI. The song was also featured in the first trailer for Kenneth Branagh’s Murder on the Orient Express remake.

Nearly two years after its release, the band released a remix of the song alongside Lil Wayne during their 2019 National College Football Championship halftime performance.","February 1, 2017",2017

“Thunder” is about not conforming to society’s standards. Dan sings about being told what to do as a child, and that he can’t follow his dreams. In the second verse, he says that he overcame everyone that told him what to do, and achieved his dreams of being on stage.

“Thunder” peaked at #4 on Billboard’s Hot 100, and scored the band their first song to surpass 1,000,000,000 (one billion) views on YouTube.","April 27, 2017",2017

","Almost five years after her groundbreaking 21, Adele examines the past and tries to right her wrongs on “Hello.” On the surface, the song appears to be about a break-up from long ago, but the song can also be interpreted as Adele’s attempt at reconciliation with her former self. In a tweet, Adele called 21 a “break-up record” and 25 a “make-up record.”

Adele revealed the broad inspiration for the song:

No, it’s not about anyone specifically. It’s about friends, ex-boyfriends, it’s about myself, it’s about my family. It’s also about my fans as well.

A day before the release, Zane Lowe interviewed Adele about her future goals, touring, the album, and the “Hello” music video. Although “Hello” was released on October 23, 2015, a portion of the song was first featured during a commercial break on the UK’s X Factor on October 18, 2015.

The accompanying music video broke the Vevo record for the most views in 24 hours with 27.7 million total. Taylor Swift previously held the record with her video for “Bad Blood”, which had 20.1 million views in a single day. “Hello” was directed by Xavier Dolan and was the first music video to be shot by IMAX cameras.

In the US, “Hello” debuted at number 1 on the Hot 100, selling a whopping 1,112,000 downloads in its first week, almost doubling Flo Rida’s previous sales record (636,000 with “Right Round”.) The track significantly broke various streaming records after being replayed 61 million times in its first week.

In an interview with i-D, Adele contextualizes “Hello”:

The song is about hurting someone’s feelings but it’s also about trying to stay in touch with myself, which sometimes can be a little bit hard to do,“ she explains. ""It’s about a yearning for the other side of me. When I’m away, I really, really miss my life at home. The way that I feel when I’m not in England, is…” (she pauses) “desperation. I can’t breathe anywhere else.” Why? “I dunno. I’m so attached to my whole life here. I get worked up that I’m missing out on things. So ‘Hello’ is about wanting to be at home and wanting to reach out to everyone I’ve ever hurt – including myself – and apologise for it.","October 23, 2015",2015

In an October 2021 BBC Radio 1 interview, Adele revealed that it was the first song written for the album, as she started it back in 2019. The song sees the singer speak about her fraught childhood, her lost marriage and the lessons learnt and unlearnt about family, love and abandonment along the way.

Following recent teases of her long-awaited fourth album on October 5, 2021, Adele took to Twitter, announcing that she would be dropping a brand new song on October 15th, sharing the teaser trailer to this track. The first verse of the song was played during Adele’s Instagram Live on October 9, 2021.

Upon its release, “Easy On Me” broke the world record for the most streamed song in 24 hours, with 24 million streams. This unseated the previously record-holders BTS for their song “Butter.”","October 15, 2021",2021

i heard that your dreams came true
guess she gave you things i didnt give to you
old friend why are you so shy
aint like you to hold back or hide from the light

i hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
but i couldnt stay away i couldnt fight it
i had hoped youd see my face
and that youd be reminded that for me it isnt over

never mind ill find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
dont forget me i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

you know how the time flies
only yesterday was the time of our lives
we were born and raised in a summer haze
bound by the surprise of our glory days
i hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
but i couldnt stay away i couldnt fight it
i had hoped youd see my face
and that youd be reminded that for me it isnt over

never mind ill find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
dont forget me i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

nothing compares no worries or cares
regrets and mistakes theyre memories made
who would have known how bittersweet this would taste

never mind ill find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you
dont forget me i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

never mind ill find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
dont forget me i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead","“Someone Like You” is the second single off of Adele’s sophomore album, 21. The track was inspired by the broken relationship that inspired most of 21. As the closing track of the album, lyrically, it speaks of Adele coming to terms with it. She wrote it with Dan Wilson.

The single is one of Adele’s most commercially successful singles. It became Adele’s first number-one single in the UK and second in the USA. As of 2015, it is the third most downloaded single of all time in the UK and the fourth best-selling single of the 21st century.

Fun fact: This was the first pure-piano ballad to ever top the Billboard Hot 100. At the time of “Someone Like You’s” ascension, there were 1,008! The second was Bruno Mars' “When I Was Your Man.”

The song won the first ever Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance, at the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012.","January 24, 2011",2011

everybody loves the things you do
from the way you talk to the way you move
everybody here is watching you
cause you feel like home youre like a dream come true
but if by chance youre here alone
can i have a moment before i go
cause ive been by myself all night long
hoping youre someone i used to know

you look like a movie
you sound like a song
my god this reminds me
of when we were young

let me photograph you in this light
in case it is the last time that we might
be exactly like we were before we realised
we were sad of getting old it made us restless
it was just like a movie
it was just like a song

i was so scared to face my fears
nobody told me that youd be here
and i swear youd moved overseas
thats what you said when you left me
you still look like a movie
you still sound like a song

when we were young","Newly-returned pop icon Adele worked with songwriter Tobias Jesso Jr. and producer Ariel Rechtshaid on the “‘70s styled shimmery disco ballad” “When We Were Young,” the second single from her album 25. She indicated in her Rolling Stone feature that the Elton John inspired ballad was her favorite on 25.

The piano used on the recording belonged to iconic minimalist composer Philip Glass. The piano is in Jesso’s grandmother’s house. Adele explained, “It used to be this mad party house and for some reason [Glass’s] piano was there so we wrote the song on that.”

In a town hall interview for SiriusXM’s The Spectrum, Adele described the setting of “When We Were Young” as a party with old friends and acquaintances, with “everyone that you’ve ever fallen out with, everyone that you’ve ever loved, everyone that you’ve never loved…And you’re all thrown together at this party when you’re like 50, and it doesn’t matter and you have so much fun and you feel like you’re 15 again.”","November 20, 2015",2015

The self-produced record finds Keem rapping about his “orange soda”—referring to the girl he’s attracted to. Keem talks to his significant other and addresses their relationship, which is troubled by her demands and by her friend’s interference.

A music video was released to complement the success of the single four months after the release of the song.","July 16, 2019",2019

The first version of the song was leaked on March 28th, 2020.

","Royals is the lead single off Lorde’s 2012 breakout EP The Love Club. It debuted at #1 in New Zealand, and eventually topped the Billboard Hot 100, outranking Katy Perry’s “Roar” and Miley Cyrus’s “Wrecking Ball”.

The song has been praised for its minimalistic beat and mature lyrics, which detail the New Zealand native’s complicated relationship to media, fame, and decadent lifestyles.

Lorde described the song as a lighthearted critique of hip-hop culture and fashion – a stance that prompted some critical backlash. She explained in a 2013 interview:

I definitely wrote “Royals” with a lightness in mind….I was definitely poking fun at a lot of things that people take to be normal. I was listening to a lot of hip-hop and I kind of started to realize that to be cool in hip-hop, you have to have that sort of car and drink that sort of vodka and have that sort of watch, and I was like, “I’ve literally never seen one of those watches in my entire life.”","June 3, 2013",2013

After the music video debuted, Lorde posted on her Facebook:

this video was borne from a dream i had a few months ago about teenagers in their own world, a world with hierarchies and initiations, where the boy who was second in command had acne on his face, and so did the girl who was queen. i dreamt about this world being so different to anything anyone had ever seen, a dark world full of tropical plants and ruins and sweat. and of this world, i dreamt about tests that didn’t need to be passed in order to be allowed in: sometimes the person who loses is stronger.","September 13, 2013",2013

baby really hurt me crying in the taxi
he dont wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess ill go home
into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i havent screwed up
shes so hard to please but shes a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands play at romance
we slow dance in the living room
but all that a stranger would see
is one girl swaying alone stroking a cheek

they say ""youre a little much for me
youre a liability
youre a little much for me""
so they pull back make other plans
i understand im a liability
get you wild make you leave
im a little much for eananana everyone
the truth is i am a toy that people enjoy
till all of the tricks dont work anymore
and then they are bored of me
i know that its exciting running through the night
but every perfect summers eating me alive until youre gone
better on my own

they say ""youre a little much for me
youre a liability
youre a little much for me""
so they pull back make other plans
i understand im a liability
get you wild make you leave
im a little much for eananana everyone

theyre gonna watch me disappear into the sun
youre all gonna watch me disappear into the sun","“Liability” is new territory for Lorde: it’s a soft, piano-driven ballad that’s far more personal than her previous work. Lorde herself described the song as “a strange part of [herself] for a lot of people to look at.”

She said further in an interview:

It’s kind of not really about anyone. It’s about me and just feeling the pressure of people finding it difficult to be friends with me- to be close to me. It was very much a product of me sitting alone in taxis and alone in my living room, and working out how to be my own best mate really.”

At a concert she said:

And this is a song that I wrote, and it marked a real turn for me. When we first started writing I was afraid of it. I thought it was corny and I was like “this is lame.” And then Jack was like, “this is straight up David Bowie chords.” And I was like, “oh yeah, okay.” I’d never really written anything about being my own best friend; about learning to take myself out to dinner, or sit in my house and, bake some weird cake, you know, about being out on my own and loving myself and respecting myself. Because it’s important, it’s very important, especially if you’re a strange, spiky, multicolored person like I am.""

The track is the second song released from Lorde’s sophomore album Melodrama. It was released abruptly on March 9, 2017, with no teasers or hints, unlike the debut of the album’s lead single “Green Light,” which was heavily promoted before its release one week prior to this song.

American songwriter and producer Jack Antonoff, who also co-produced and wrote “Green Light,” returns for “Liability” with the same credits.","March 9, 2017",2017

Over those years, 2015 to 2017, Lorde became an adult and moved away from her “glossy idiot god” teenage-self and “crossed over” to adulthood. In a Facebook post on her 20th birthday, she described 2016 as a “colossal year.”

The song was promoted heavily via the website “imwaitingforit.com” which released teasers of the music video for the track for three days before it officially dropped. One day before the website’s launch, the first teaser was aired as a commercial across New Zealand, Lorde’s home country, and two days before the song dropped, she left clues around specific locations in Auckland, New Zealand, containing lyrics from the song and hints about its title.

It is Lorde’s first solo release since her 2013 debut album Pure Heroine, and since her curation of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay soundtrack. The single’s artwork was painted by Sam McKinniss.","March 2, 2017",2017

The idea of honey, a free-flowing liquid that tempts people with its flavour and benefit, serves as a metaphor for the love and hard work needed to make a relationship taste as sweet as honey. Honey is hard to collect and takes a long time to create, just like Raveena’s ability to feel such a compelling connection.","May 2, 2018",2018

","“Juicy” is the first single from Big’s debut album, Ready to Die, and is the track that established him as a titan.

It was one of the first mainstream rap songs about a rapper’s own rise to the top. But beyond that, this is also the story of how hip-hop itself became popular.

The title is derived from Mtume’s 1983 hit “Juicy Fruit” – Tony Humphries' “Fruity Instrumental” remix was sampled directly for the beat. The chorus of “Juicy” is a flip of Mtume’s chorus with slightly different words, sung by (uncredited) R&B girl group Total.","August 9, 1994",1994

The song marked a major stylistic change from the hardcore, aggressive style of Big’s early work. The music utilized a smoother West Coast g-funk aesthetic, while Big embraced a new ladies' man persona. Producer Easy Mo Bee remarked: “all of a sudden his voice calmed down. That became his new vocal style.”

“Big Poppa” peaked at #6 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart in March 1995. It was nominated for “Best Rap Solo Performance” and “Best Rap Song of the Year” at the 1996 Grammy Awards, and also went on to win at the Billboard Awards.

The title is based on one of the Notorious B.I.G.’s many nicknames. The line “I love when you call me Big Poppa” is sampled from his verse from the remix of Supercat’s song “Dolly My Baby”,“ released in 1993. The song also features a prominent sample from the The Isley Brothers‘ 1983 slow jam “Between The Sheets.”","February 20, 1995",1995

please hang up and try your call again
please hang up— is a recording","In this final track off of The Notorious B.I.G.’s classic debut album, Ready to Die, Biggie calls up Puff Daddy in the middle of the night to explain that he’s about to commit suicide. In one, long verse, he describes how he feels unloved and expresses guilt for all the crimes he’s committed, while Puff tries to talk him out of killing himself in the song’s ad-libs.

The telephone effect used on Puffy’s vocals, as well as other sound effects—e.g. gunshots and Big’s body falling to the floor—make the track both cinematic and haunting. Despite Puff’s pleas, Big pulls the trigger at the end of the track. Biggie’s fictional death directly ties into his follow-up album, March 1997’s Life After Death.

This conceptual track became even more significant after The Notorious B.I.G. was murdered in a drive-by shooting on March 9, 1997.","September 13, 1994",1994

The song’s hook interpolates Slick Rick’s lyrics from the 1985 hip-hop classic “La Di Da Di,” while the beat is built around a sample from “Rise,” the 1979 #1 hit by jazz-fusion trumpeter Herb Alpert.

A funky party song filled with boasts, pick-up lines, and pop culture references, “Hypnotize” remains one of Biggie’s best known hits. The song’s action-packed music video is one of the most iconic of the 1990s.

On April 26, 1997, “Hypnotize” became the second single to ever debut at #2 on Billboard’s Hot 100 (the first was Bone Thugs-N-Harmony’s “Tha Crossroads” one year earlier). It went #1 the following week, tying Bone Thugs and The Beatles for the fastest rise to the top of the chart.

“Hypnotize” replaced Puff Daddy’s “Can’t Nobody Hold Me Down” at #1, marking Bad Boy’s second chart-topper. It remained at #1 for three weeks, until it was kicked down to #2 by Hanson’s “MMMBop” on May 24.","March 1, 1997",1997
