Dolly Parton,9 to 5,"9 to 5 Lyrics
Tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...

They let you dream just to watch them shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day your ship will come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way
Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life putting money in his wallet
9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life putting money in his wallet12Embed",country
Taylor Swift,Nothing New (Taylor's Version) [From the Vault],"Nothing New (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
They tell you while you're young
""Girls, go out and have your fun""
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, ""She looks like she's been through it""
Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?

I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room? (Ahh)
People love an ingénue (Ahh)
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up to breaking down?
And I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

I know someday I'm gonna meet her
It's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her then I'll cry myself to sleep
Oh woah ohh, oh woah ohh, oh, oh

I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me, will you still want me
Will you still want me when I'm nothing new?44Embed",country
Maren Morris,My Church,"My Church Lyrics
I’ve cussed on a Sunday
I’ve cheated and I’ve lied
I’ve fallen down from grace
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial

Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

When Hank brings the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold, cold heart burnin'
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church

Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get an amen?
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singin' every single verse
Yeah, I guess that’s my church
Yeah, I guess that’s my church
Yeah, I guess that’s my church23Embed",country
Bob Dylan,The Times They Are A-Changin',"The Times They Are A-Changin’ LyricsCome gather 'round people, wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times, they are a-changin'
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
For the times, they are a-changin'38Embed",country
Harry Styles,Girl Crush,"Girl Crush Lyrics
I got a girl crush
I hate to admit it, but
I got a heart rush
It ain't slowing down
I got it real bad
Want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh
She's givin' you now

I wanna taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
And I've got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush

I don't get no sleep
I don't get no peace
Thinking about her
Under your bed sheets
The way that she's whisperin'
The way that she's pullin' you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't get her off my mind
I wanna taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
And I've got a girl crush

Taylor Swift,Holy Ground,"Holy Ground Lyrics
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd
'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you26Embed",country
Neil Young,Heart of Gold,"Heart of Gold Lyrics

I want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give

That keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old


I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line

That keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold

Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
You keep me searchin' and I'm growing old

Mother Mother,Verbatim,"Verbatim Lyrics
Uh-oh, ye-ah, uh-oh, ye-ah-oh
Uh-oh, ye-ah, uh-oh

I wear women's underwear
And then I go to strike a pose in my full-length mirror
I cross my legs just like a queer
But my libido is strong when a lady is near, yeah
What defines a straight man's straight?
Is it the boxer in the brief or a twelve-ounce steak?
Nah, I'll tell you what a woman loves most
It's a man who can slap but can also stroke

Going in the wind is an eddy of the truth and it's naked
It's verbatim and it's shakin'
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No more getting elated
No more listless invitations

UGH!

I live by a hospital
And every day, I go out walking past its sickly windows
I see people dying there
But my tender age makes it hard to care
The incinerator and a big smokestack
It's a phallic symbol and it makes me laugh (Makes me laugh)
All I need is a heart attack, c'mon
Humble my bones with a cardiac (Humble my bones with a cardiac)
Going in the wind is an eddy of the truth and it's naked
It's verbatim and it's shakin'
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No more getting elated
No more listless invitations

For the love of fuck (Love of fuck)
For the sake of Pete (Sake of Pete)
Did you ever really think you'd love (Ever really think you'd love)
A guy like me? (A guy like me?)
I am the rooster in the morning (Rooster in the morning)
I'm the cock of the day (Cock of the day)
I'm the boxer in the briefs (Boxer in the briefs)
I'm a twelve-ounce steak (Twelve-ounce steak)

Eh-oh, eh-oh

Yabo, yabo

Bob Dylan,All Along the Watchtower,"All Along the Watchtower Lyrics
""There must be some way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth""

""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late""

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl42Embed",country
Taylor Swift,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Lyrics
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together
Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together

Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""

Lil Durk,Broadway Girls,"Broadway Girls Lyrics
2 AM at a Broadway bar
She's puttin’ her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don’t mean
And you know

I met her down at Aldean's
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around

Oh, there’s two things that you’re gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I’da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave ’em alone)
Leave them Broadway girls alone

They town just told me, ""Don't trust 'em""
Broadway girls a trap
They on me, they tryna finesse me
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
I can't run out of money
The trenches love me forever
They treat me like Ed in London
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars
Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone

Oh, think I oughta settle down
And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh
But I told 'em that I'm savage
They just tryna tell me there's

There's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls

Taylor Swift,Begin Again,"Begin Again Lyrics
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again


And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

I'm not the road that you take when you're lookin' for a shortcut, uh
I ain't the steppin' stone, to be steppin' on, I ain't nobody's crutch

I'm not the cheap one, lookin' at me son, you ain't lookin' at free

Ain't got no check for 'em, if you checkin' in
Mothafucka check this out

Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own

I'm not the trash can, not the last man at the finish line now
I'm not the new kid, on the block
That you can just follow and push around
I'm not the fuckin' needle in the haystack, that you finally found
This ain't no free rent, come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down
I'm not a bus ride you can hop inside, and just roll away clean
Not the wheel on the wagon you wanna break
'Cause I hold up the weight for the team
I'm not the gold watch, and the new truck
That you scheming to check out
Unless you're looking to check out 
What a mess now (c'mon)
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, oh, 'til it's gone
Oh, what can I do if I do 'til it's gone

I jump to the sky for my people
I walk through the fire, I give love when it's equal
Don't tell me not to complain about my money and fame
When you come around and tellin' me I changed
Damn right I fuckin' changed
When this fuckin' change in my pocket
Hit the bucket, it was a rocket all a sudden
I went from shoppin' without nothin'
To goin' shoppin' for my cousins
Now that the cops know that I'm buzzin'
They wanna drop me in the oven
Pull me over just to say ""I'm a fan""
Hip-hop, gotta love it, fuck it
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it

I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

Taylor Swift,Dear John,"Dear John Lyrics
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I should've known

You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known
You should've known
Don't you think I was too young?

Taylor Swift,Enchanted,"Enchanted Lyrics
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
'Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, ""Hey""

It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you
Please don't be in love (Ooh)
With someone else
Please don't have somebody (Ooh, hey)
Waiting on you

This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless (Please don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please don't have somebody waiting on you)
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever (Please don't be in love with someone else)
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you61Embed",country
Taylor Swift,I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor's Version) [From the Vault],"I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes
Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin'
""Why did you let her go?""
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had?

Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And, yeah, I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me when you're out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
""Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me""
I bet you think about me34Embed",country
Miley Cyrus,Angels Like You,"Angels Like You Lyrics
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, only ""baby""
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right

I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me

I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'm everything they said I would be

I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you
Tonight, mother says you don't look happy
Close your eyes
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me

I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
Oh, ah, ah

Ah, oh

I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything (Everything)
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me, oh

Brad Paisley,Whiskey Lullaby,"Whiskey Lullaby Lyrics
She put him out
Like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night

He put that bottle to his head
And pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her 'til I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night...

She put that bottle to her head
And pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa

Tyler Childers,Feathered Indians,"Feathered Indians Lyrics
Well my buckle makes impressions
On the inside of her thigh
There are little feathered Indians
Where we tussled through the night
If I'd known she was religious
Then I wouldn't have came stoned
To the house of such an angel
Too fucked up to get back home

Lookin' over West Virginia
Smoking Spirits on the roof
She asked ain't anybody told ya
That them things are bad for you
I said many folks have warned me
There's been several people try
But up 'til now, there ain't been nothing
That I couldn't leave behind

Hold me close my dear
Sing your whispering song
Softly in my ear
And I will sing along
Honey tell me how your love runs true
And how I can always count on you
To be there when the bullets fly
I'd run across the river just to hold you tonight
Well my heart is sweating bullets
From the circles it has raced
Like a little feathered indian
Callin' out the clouds for rain
I'd go runnin' through the thicket
I'd go careless through the thorns
Just to hold her for a minute
Though it'd leave me wanting more

Hold me close my dear
Sing your whispering song
Softly in my ear
And I will sing along
Honey tell me how your love runs true
And how I can always count on you
To be there when the bullets fly
I'd run across the river just to hold you tonight1Embed",country

Billie Eilish,​lovely,"​lovely Lyrics
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Woah, yeah
Yeah, ah

Ryan Gosling,City of Stars/May Finally Come True,"City of Stars/May Finally Come True Lyrics
City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
There's so much that I can't see
Who knows?
I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
That now, our dreams
They've finally come true

City of stars
Just one thing everybody wants
There in the bars
And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It's love
Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else

A rush, a glance
A touch, a dance
A look in somebody's eyes
To light up the skies
To open the world and send it reeling
A voice that says, ""I'll be here""
And ""you'll be alright""
I don't care if I know
Just where I will go
'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling
A rat-tat-tat on my heart
Think I want it to stay
City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
You never shined so brightly100Embed",pop
Macklemore,Can't Hold Us,"Can’t Hold Us Lyrics
Hey, hey, hey
Good to see you
Come on, dude, let's go
Yeah! Let's go!
Ha-ha-ha-ha alright
Alright, okay
Alright, okay
Alright, okay

Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the back (back) pack (pack), fat (fat) cat (cat), crushin'
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give that to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
Labels out here, now they can't tell me nothin' (Hey, hey, hey)
We give it to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)
And then we keep marching, I said
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Let's go!
Na na na na, na na na na (Uh-huh)
Hey (And all my people sing)
Na na na na, na na na na (Hey, hey, that's right)
Hey (Here we go, all right, uh)
And all my people sing
Na na na na, na na na na (You do it, Ray)
Oh (Ha-ha, let's go)
And all my people sing
Na na na na, na na na na
Mack-le-e-e-e-e-more!
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment (Ooh)

Lukas Graham,7 Years,"7 Years Lyrics
Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once I was seven years old
Once I was seven years old187Embed",pop
BTS,Dynamite,"Dynamite Lyrics
'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight

Shoes on, get up in the morn'
Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
King Kong, kick the drum
Rolling on like a Rolling Stone
Sing song when I'm walkin' home
Jump up to the top, LeBron
Ding-dong, call me on my phone
Ice tea and a game of ping pong

This is gettin' heavy, can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (Woo-hoo)
Life is sweet as honey, yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Hey, so let's go

'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (Hey)
Shinin' through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah-oh-oh
Bring a friend, join the crowd, whoever wanna come along
Word up, talk the talk, just move like we off the wall
Day or night, the sky's alight, so we dance to the break of dawn (Hey)
Ladies and gentlemen, I got the medicine so you should keep ya eyes on the ball

Huh, this is gettin' heavy, can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (Woo-hoo)
Life is sweet as honey, yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Let's go

'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (Hey)
Shinin' through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah-oh-oh

Dyn-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, life is dynamite
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, life is dynamite
Shinin' through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah-oh-oh

Dyn-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Light it up like dynamite
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na, na-na, ayy
Light it up like dynamite
'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
Shinin' through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite
(This is ah) 'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (Alight, oh)
Shinin' through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light (Light) it (It) up (Up) like (Like) dynamite (Dynamite), woah-oh-oh

Dyn-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, life is dynamite (Life is dynamite)
Dyn-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, life is dynamite (Oh)
Shinin' through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah-oh-oh287Embed",pop
